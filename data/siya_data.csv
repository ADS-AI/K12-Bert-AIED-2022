0,"All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of matter"
1,"Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us"
2,Even our own human bodies are made of matter!Different objects can be made of different types of materials (the matter from which objects are made)
3,"For example, a cupboard (an object) is made of wood, nails, hinges and knobs (the materials)"
4,The properties of the materials will affect the properties of the object
5,"In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable"
6,"Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes (eg clay, dough)"
7,Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires (eg copper)
8,The boiling and melting points of substances tells us the temperature at which the substance will boil or melt
9,"This helps us to classify substances as solids, liquids or gases at a specific temperature"
10,The diagram below shows one way in which matter can be classified (grouped) according to its different properties
11,"As you read further in this chapter, you will see that there are also other ways of classifying materials, for example according to whether or not they are good electrical conductors."
12,In this chapter we will explore the states of matter and then look at the kinetic molecular theory
13,We will also examine how the kinetic theory of matter helps explain boiling and melting points as well as other properties of matter
14,Diffusion can be seen as a spreading out of particles resulting in an even distribution of the particles
15,You can see diffusion when you place a drop of food colouring in water
16,"If matter were not made of particles that are constantly moving then we would only see a clump of colour when we put the food colouring in water, as there would be nothing that could move about and mix in with the water"
17,"In 1828 Robert Brown observed that pollen grains suspended in water moved about in a rapid, irregular motion"
18,Brownian motion can also be seen as the random to and fro movement of particles
19,"Matter exists in one of three states, namely solid, liquid and gas"
20,A liquid takes on the shape of the container that it is in
21,Matter can change between these states by either adding heat or removing heat
22,As we heat an object (eg water) it goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas
23,Evaporation from a liquid's surface can happen at a wide range of temperatures
24,If more energy is added then bubbles of gas appear inside the liquid and this is known as boiling
25,Sublimation is the process of going from a solid to a gas
26,Deposition is the process of going from a gas to a solid
27,"If we know the melting and boiling point of a substance then we can say what state (solid, liquid or gas) it will be in at any temperature"
28,A heating curve of a substance gives the changes in temperature as we move from a solid to a liquid to a gas
29,A cooling curve gives the changes in temperature as we move from gas to liquid to solid
30,"An important observation is that as a substance melts or boils, the temperature remains constant until the substance has changed state"
31,This is because all the heat energy goes into breaking or forming the bonds between the molecules
32,The following diagrams give examples of what heating and cooling curves look like:
33,We have now looked at many examples of the types of matter and materials that exist around us and we have investigated some of the ways that materials are classified
34,"In order to understand this, we need to take a closer look at the building blocks of matter — the atom"
35,Atoms are the basis of all the structures and organisms in the universe
36,"The planets, sun, grass, trees, air we breathe and people are all made up of different combinations of atoms.Video: VPrkk"
37,The periodic table of the elements is a method of showing the chemical elements in a table with the elements arranged in order of increasing atomic number
38,Most of the work that was done to arrive at the periodic table that we know can be attributed to a Russian chemist named Dmitri Mendeleev
39,Mendeleev designed the table in 1869 in such a way that recurring (periodic) trends or patterns in the properties of the elements could be shown
40,"Using the trends he observed, he left gaps for those elements that he thought were “missing”"
41,He also predicted the properties that he thought the missing elements would have when they were discovered
42,Many of these elements were indeed discovered and Mendeleev's predictions were proved to be correct
43,"To show the recurring properties that he had observed, Mendeleev began new rows in his table so that elements with similar properties were in the same vertical columns, called groups"
44,The full periodic table is reproduced at the front of this book
45,"These are the energies needed to remove the second, third, or fourth electron respectively"
46,"If you look at a periodic table, you will see the groups numbered at the top of each column"
47,The groups are numbered from left to right starting with 1 and ending with 18
48,This is the convention that we will use in this book
49,"On some periodic tables you may see that the groups are numbered from left to right as follows: 1, 2, then an open space which contains the transition elements, followed by groups 3 to 8"
50,A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table of the elements
51,"The periods are labelled from top to bottom, starting with 1 and ending with 7"
52,For each element on the periodic table we can give its period number and its group number
53,We can also determine the electronic structure of an element from its position on the periodic table
54,In Chapter 4 you worked out the electronic configuration of various elements
55,Using the periodic table we can easily give the electronic configurations of any element
56,"For example, phosphorus () is in the third period and group 15"
57,"Looking at the figure above, we see that the p-orbital is being filled"
58,Similar trends are observed in the other periods of the periodic table
59,The chlorides are compounds with chlorine and the oxides are compounds with oxygen
60,"no oxides, but fluorine does combine with oxygen in compounds called oxygen fluorides"
61,Draw a line graph to show the relationship between atomic number (on the x-axis) and ionisation energy (y-axis)
62,A chemical bond is formed when atoms are held together by attractive forces
63,"This attraction occurs when electrons are shared between atoms, or when electrons are exchanged between the atoms that are involved in the bond"
64,"The sharing or exchange of electrons takes place so that the outer energy levels of the atoms involved are filled, making the atoms are more stable"
65,"If an electron is shared, it means that it will spend its time moving in the electron orbitals around both atoms"
66,If an electron is exchanged it means that it is transferred from one atom to another
67,In other words one atom gains an electron while the other loses an electron.Chemical bond A chemical bond is the physical process that causes atoms and molecules to be attracted to each other and held together in more stable chemical compounds
68,The type of bond that is formed depends on the elements that are involved
69,"In this chapter, we will be looking at three types of chemical bonding: covalent, ionic and metallic bonding.You need to remember that it is the valence electrons (those in the outermost level) that are involved in bonding and that atoms will try to fill their outer energy levels so that they are more stable"
70,"The noble gases have completely full outer energy levels, so are very stable and do not react easily with other atoms."
71,A medium is the substance or material through which a pulse moves
72,The medium does not create the pulse and the medium is not the pulse
73,"Therefore the medium does not travel with the pulse as the pulse moves through it.In each medium, the particles that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest position"
74,"In order for a pulse to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other.Medium A medium is the substance or material in which a pulse will move"
75,"The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket"
76,"All waves have the same properties.Waves do not only occur in water, they occur in any kind of medium"
77,Earthquakes release enough energy to create waves that are powerful enough to travel through the rock of the Earth
78,When your friend speaks to you sound waves are produced that travel through the air to your ears
79,A wave is simply the disturbance of a medium by moving energy but how is it different from a pulse?
80,Longitudinal waves A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
81,When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave itself
82,We will do the same for longitudinal waves.The question is how do we construct such a wave?A longitudinal wave is seen best in a slinky spring
83,Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves parallel to the direction in which the spring was pulled
84,The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium
85,"The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave.Video: VPdkfAs in the case of transverse waves the following properties can be defined for longitudinal waves:wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed."
86,A tuning fork is an instrument used by musicians to create sound waves of a specific frequency
87,They are often used to tune musical instruments.Sound waves coming from a tuning fork are caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork which push against the air particles in front of it
88,As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed
89,The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction
90,"As the particles continue to push against each other, the sound wave travels through the air"
91,"Due to this motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air"
92,"This means that in media where the particles are closer together, sound waves will travel faster.Tuning forkSound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together)"
93,Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids.A sound wave is a pressure wave
94,This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates
95,These compressions and rarefactions arise because the source vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.
96,The most common example of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is visible light
97,"Everyone is very familiar with light in everyday life, you can only see things because light bounces off them and enters your eyes"
98,This alone makes it worthwhile to learn about it but there are also very many other applications of EM radiation
99,It is called electromagnetic because there are electric and magnetic fields making up the radiation
100,"We will look at this in more detail a little later.In everyday experience, light doesn't seem to have many special properties but it does: A huge spectrum: The light we can see (visible EM radiation) is only a small part of all of the EM radiation (electromagnetic spectrum) that exists"
101,Nature's speed limit: Nothing moves faster than the speed of light
102,Wave nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a wave which we call wave-like behaviour
103,Particle nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a particle which we call particle-like behaviour
104,No medium required: EM radiation can propagate without a medium through which to move even though they are waves
105,We will discuss this in the following sections and in even more detail in Grades 11 and 12.
106,Diagrams of compounds are very useful because they help us to picture how the atoms are arranged in the compound and they help us to see the shape of the compound
107,"There are three types of diagrams that are commonly used: Wireframe or stick models In this model, the bonds between atoms are shown as “sticks”"
108,Ball and stick models This is a 3-dimensional molecular model that uses “balls” to represent atoms and “sticks” to represent the bonds between them
109,The centres of the atoms (the balls) are connected by straight lines which represent the bonds between them
110,Table 12.1 shows examples of the different types of models for all the types of compounds.Covalent molecularCovalent networkIonic networkMetallic networkName of compoundglucosegraphitesilver chloridezincFormula or Stick modelBall-and-stick modelSpace-filling model Table 12.1: Different representations for compounds CanvasMol (www.alteredqualia.com/canvasmol) is a website that allows you to view several compounds
111,"You do not need to know these compounds, this is simply to allow you to see one way of representing compounds."
112,The synthesis (forming) of water () from hydrogen gas () and oxygen gas () is another example of chemical change
113,A simplified diagram of this reaction is shown in Figure 13.3
114,The chemical bonds between in and between in are broken and new bonds between and (to form ) are formed
115,"A chemical change has taken place.Video: VPbhyA mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas is used as a fuel to get rockets into space.There are some important things to remember about chemical changes: Arrangement of particles During a chemical change, the particles themselves are changed in some way"
116,"In the example of hydrogen peroxide that was used earlier, the molecules were split up into their component atoms"
117,The number of particles will change because each molecule breaks down into two water molecules () and one oxygen molecule ()
118,Energy changes The energy changes that take place during a chemical reaction are much greater than those that take place during a physical change in matter
119,"During a chemical reaction, energy is used up in order to break bonds and then energy is released when the new product is formed"
120,Reversibility Chemical changes are far more difficult to reverse than physical changes
121,"When hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen, it is almost impossible to get back to hydrogen peroxide"
122,"Mass conservation Mass is conserved during a chemical change, but the number of molecules may change"
123,"In the example of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for every two molecules of hydrogen peroxide that decomposes, three molecules are formed (two water and one oxygen)"
124,"Table 13.1 highlights these concepts for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.Moleculestwo moleculesthree moleculesEnergy changesenergy taken in when bonds are brokenenergy given off when bonds are formedMass is conservedAtoms are conserved oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms Table 13.1: Important concepts in chemical change Exercise 13.1See solutions For each of the following say whether a chemical or a physical change occurs"

126,"As we have already mentioned, a number of changes can occur when elements are combined with one another"
127,One way of representing chemical changes is through balanced chemical equations
128,A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction by using symbols for the elements involved
129,"For example, if we look at the reaction between iron and sulfur to form iron sulfide , we could represent these changes in a sentence, in a word equation or using chemical symbols: Sentence: Iron reacts with sulfur to form iron sulfide"
130,A chemical formula shows each element by its symbol and also shows how many atoms of each element are found in that compound
131,The number of atoms (if greater than one) is shown as a subscript.The following exercise serves as revision
132,"Magnetism is an interaction that allows certain kinds of objects, which are called 'magnetic' objects, to exert forces on each other without physically touching"
133,A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic 'field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object
134,A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object
135,The further away the objects are the weaker the magnetic force will be.Video: VPfkkHumans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years
136,"For example, lodestone is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite"
137,"It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around BCE in Europe and around BCE in Asia.Magnetic objects stuck to a magnetThe root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone."
138,Electrostatics is the study of electric charge which is at rest or static (not moving)
139,In this chapter we will look at some of the basic principles of electrostatics as well as the principle of conservation of charge.Video: VPfmg
140,When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is not in a complete circuit you are measuring the emf of the battery
141,"This is the maximum amount of work per coulomb of charge the battery can do to drive charge from one terminal, through the circuit, to the other terminal.The volt is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827).Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is in a complete circuit you are measuring the terminal potential difference of the battery"
142,Although this is measured in volts it is not identical to the emf
143,The difference will be the work done to drive charge through the battery.BatteriesOne lead of the voltmeter is connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end
144,The voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of a circuit but must be connected in parallel.
145,Many reactions in chemistry and all biological reactions (reactions in living systems) take place in water
146,In this chapter we will look at some of these reactions in detail
147,Almost all the reactions that occur in aqueous solutions involve ions
148,"We will look at three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, namely precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions"
149,"Before we can learn about the types of reactions, we need to first look at ions in aqueous solutions and electrical conductivity.Video: VPbls"
150,"Sometimes it is important to know exactly how many particles (eg atoms or molecules) are in a sample of a substance, or what quantity of a substance is needed for a chemical reaction to take place.The amount of substance is so important in chemistry that it is given its own name, which is the mole.Mole The mole (abbreviation “mol”) is the SI (Standard International) unit for “amount of substance”"
151,The mole is a counting unit just like hours or days
152,We can easily count one second or one minute or one hour
153,"If we want bigger units of time, we refer to days, months and years"
154,"We call this number Avogadro's number.Avogadro's number The number of particles in a mole, equal to"
155,"If we had this number of cold drink cans, then we could cover the surface of the earth to a depth of over"
156,"If you could count atoms at a rate of 10 million per second, then it would take you 2 billion years to count the atoms in one mole!The original hypothesis that was proposed by Amadeo Avogadro was that “equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules”"
157,"His ideas were not accepted by the scientific community and it was only four years after his death, that his original hypothesis was accepted and that it became known as “Avogadro's Law”"
158,"In honour of his contribution to science, the number of particles in one mole was named Avogadro's number.We use Avogadro's number and the mole in chemistry to help us quantify what happens in chemical reaction"
159,If we measure of carbon we have one mole or carbon atoms
160,"You will remember that when the mass, in grams, of an element is equal to its relative atomic mass, the sample contains one mole of that element"
161,This mass is called the molar mass of that element.You may sometimes see the molar mass written as
162,"We will use in this book, but you should be aware of the alternate notation.It is worth remembering the following: On the periodic table, the relative atomic mass that is shown can be interpreted in two ways"
163,"The mass (in grams) of a single, average atom of that element relative to the mass of an atom of carbon"
164,The average atomic mass of all the isotopes of that element
165,"ElementRelative atomic mass (u)Molar mass ()Mass of one mole of the element (g)MagnesiumLithiumOxygenNitrogenIron Table 19.1: The relationship between relative atomic mass, molar mass and the mass of one mole for a number of elements"
166,Calculate the number of moles of iron (Fe) in an sample
167,"If we look at the periodic table, we see that the molar mass of iron is"
168,"This means that 1 mole of iron will have a mass of .If 1 mole of iron has a mass of , then: the number of moles of iron in must be:There are 2 moles of iron in the sample"
169,You need to imagine that the horizontal line is like a division sign and that the vertical line is like a multiplication sign
170,"So, for example, if you want to calculate , then the remaining two letters in the triangle are and and is above with a division sign between them"
171,"Your calculation will then be Remember that when you use the equation , the mass is always in grams (g) and molar mass is in grams per mol ()"
172,Always write the units next to any number you use in a formula or sum
173,Calculate the number of moles of copper there are in a sample that with a mass of
174,Calculate the number of atoms there are in a sample of aluminium that with a mass of
175,"However, you need to remember that all your calculations will apply to the whole compound"
176,"So, when you calculate the molar mass of a covalent compound, you will need to add the molar mass of each atom in that compound"
177,The number of moles will also apply to the whole molecule
178,"For example, if you have one mole of nitric acid () the molar mass is and there are molecules of nitric acid"
179,This is the mass of all the atoms in one formula unit of the compound
180,"For example, one mole of sodium chloride () has a formula mass of and there are molecules of sodium chloride in one formula unit.In a balanced chemical equation, the number that is written in front of the element or compound, shows the mole ratio in which the reactants combine to form a product"
181,"If there are no numbers in front of the element symbol, this means the number is '1'.Video: VPezceg In this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen molecules to produce 2 moles of ammonia molecules"
182,Scalars are physical quantities which have only a number value or a size (magnitude)
183,A scalar tells you how much of something there is.Scalar A scalar is a physical quantity that has only a magnitude (size)
184,"For example, a person buys a tub of margarine which is labelled with a mass of"
185,The mass of the tub of margarine is a scalar quantity
186,"It only needs one number to describe it, in this case, .Vectors are different because they are physical quantities which have a size and a direction"
187,A vector tells you how much of something there is and which direction it is in.Vector A vector is a physical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction
188,"For example, a car is travelling east along a freeway at"
189,The car is moving at (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going – east (this is the direction)
190,Your weight is proportional to your mass (magnitude) and is always in the direction towards the centre of the earth
191,"This chapter is about how things move along a straight line or, more scientifically, how things move in one dimension"
192,This is useful for learning how to describe the movement (motion) of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks
193,There are three features of motion that we use to describe exactly how an object moves
194,They are:The jerk is the name we give to how fast the acceleration is changing.Traffic often moves along a straight line
195,"The word energy comes from the Greek word energeia (ένέργεια), meaning activity or operation"
196,Energy is closely linked to mass and cannot be created or destroyed
197,In this chapter we will consider gravitational potential and kinetic energy.Video: VPgjm
198,"As far as we know, the Earth we live on is the only planet that is able to support life"
199,"Amongst other factors, the Earth is just the right distance from the sun to have temperatures that are suitable for life to exist"
200,"Also, the Earth's atmosphere has exactly the right type of gases in the right amounts for life to survive"
201,"Our planet also has water on its surface, which is something very unique"
202,"In fact, Earth is often called the “Blue Planet” because most of it is covered in water"
203,"This water is made up of freshwater in rivers and lakes, the saltwater of the oceans and estuaries, groundwater and water vapour"
204,"Together, all these water bodies are called the hydrosphere.The EarthVideo: VPbzp"
205,"All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of matter"
206,"Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us"
207,Even our own human bodies are made of matter!Different objects can be made of different types of materials (the matter from which objects are made)
208,"For example, a cupboard (an object) is made of wood, nails, hinges and knobs (the materials)"
209,The properties of the materials will affect the properties of the object
210,"In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable"
211,"Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes (eg clay, dough)"
212,Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires (eg copper)
213,The boiling and melting points of substances tells us the temperature at which the substance will boil or melt
214,"This helps us to classify substances as solids, liquids or gases at a specific temperature"
215,The diagram below shows one way in which matter can be classified (grouped) according to its different properties
216,"As you read further in this chapter, you will see that there are also other ways of classifying materials, for example according to whether or not they are good electrical conductors."
217,In this chapter we will explore the states of matter and then look at the kinetic molecular theory
218,We will also examine how the kinetic theory of matter helps explain boiling and melting points as well as other properties of matter
219,Diffusion can be seen as a spreading out of particles resulting in an even distribution of the particles
220,You can see diffusion when you place a drop of food colouring in water
221,"If matter were not made of particles that are constantly moving then we would only see a clump of colour when we put the food colouring in water, as there would be nothing that could move about and mix in with the water"
222,"In 1828 Robert Brown observed that pollen grains suspended in water moved about in a rapid, irregular motion"
223,Brownian motion can also be seen as the random to and fro movement of particles

269,"The sharing or exchange of electrons takes place so that the outer energy levels of the atoms involved are filled, making the atoms are more stable"
270,"If an electron is shared, it means that it will spend its time moving in the electron orbitals around both atoms"
271,If an electron is exchanged it means that it is transferred from one atom to another
272,In other words one atom gains an electron while the other loses an electron.Chemical bond A chemical bond is the physical process that causes atoms and molecules to be attracted to each other and held together in more stable chemical compounds
273,The type of bond that is formed depends on the elements that are involved
274,"In this chapter, we will be looking at three types of chemical bonding: covalent, ionic and metallic bonding.You need to remember that it is the valence electrons (those in the outermost level) that are involved in bonding and that atoms will try to fill their outer energy levels so that they are more stable"
275,"The noble gases have completely full outer energy levels, so are very stable and do not react easily with other atoms."
276,A medium is the substance or material through which a pulse moves
277,The medium does not create the pulse and the medium is not the pulse
278,"Therefore the medium does not travel with the pulse as the pulse moves through it.In each medium, the particles that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest position"
279,"In order for a pulse to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other.Medium A medium is the substance or material in which a pulse will move"
280,"The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket"
281,"All waves have the same properties.Waves do not only occur in water, they occur in any kind of medium"
282,Earthquakes release enough energy to create waves that are powerful enough to travel through the rock of the Earth
283,When your friend speaks to you sound waves are produced that travel through the air to your ears
284,A wave is simply the disturbance of a medium by moving energy but how is it different from a pulse?
285,Longitudinal waves A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
286,When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave itself
287,We will do the same for longitudinal waves.The question is how do we construct such a wave?A longitudinal wave is seen best in a slinky spring
288,Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves parallel to the direction in which the spring was pulled
289,The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium
290,"The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave.Video: VPdkfAs in the case of transverse waves the following properties can be defined for longitudinal waves:wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed."
291,A tuning fork is an instrument used by musicians to create sound waves of a specific frequency
292,They are often used to tune musical instruments.Sound waves coming from a tuning fork are caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork which push against the air particles in front of it
293,As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed
294,The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction
295,"As the particles continue to push against each other, the sound wave travels through the air"
296,"Due to this motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air"
297,"This means that in media where the particles are closer together, sound waves will travel faster.Tuning forkSound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together)"
298,Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids.A sound wave is a pressure wave
299,This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates
300,These compressions and rarefactions arise because the source vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.
301,The most common example of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is visible light
302,"Everyone is very familiar with light in everyday life, you can only see things because light bounces off them and enters your eyes"
303,This alone makes it worthwhile to learn about it but there are also very many other applications of EM radiation
304,It is called electromagnetic because there are electric and magnetic fields making up the radiation
305,"We will look at this in more detail a little later.In everyday experience, light doesn't seem to have many special properties but it does: A huge spectrum: The light we can see (visible EM radiation) is only a small part of all of the EM radiation (electromagnetic spectrum) that exists"
306,Nature's speed limit: Nothing moves faster than the speed of light
307,Wave nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a wave which we call wave-like behaviour
308,Particle nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a particle which we call particle-like behaviour
309,No medium required: EM radiation can propagate without a medium through which to move even though they are waves
310,We will discuss this in the following sections and in even more detail in Grades 11 and 12.
311,Diagrams of compounds are very useful because they help us to picture how the atoms are arranged in the compound and they help us to see the shape of the compound
312,"There are three types of diagrams that are commonly used: Wireframe or stick models In this model, the bonds between atoms are shown as “sticks”"
313,Ball and stick models This is a 3-dimensional molecular model that uses “balls” to represent atoms and “sticks” to represent the bonds between them
314,The centres of the atoms (the balls) are connected by straight lines which represent the bonds between them
315,Table 12.1 shows examples of the different types of models for all the types of compounds.Covalent molecularCovalent networkIonic networkMetallic networkName of compoundglucosegraphitesilver chloridezincFormula or Stick modelBall-and-stick modelSpace-filling model Table 12.1: Different representations for compounds CanvasMol (www.alteredqualia.com/canvasmol) is a website that allows you to view several compounds
316,"You do not need to know these compounds, this is simply to allow you to see one way of representing compounds."
317,The synthesis (forming) of water () from hydrogen gas () and oxygen gas () is another example of chemical change
318,A simplified diagram of this reaction is shown in Figure 13.3
319,The chemical bonds between in and between in are broken and new bonds between and (to form ) are formed
320,"A chemical change has taken place.Video: VPbhyA mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas is used as a fuel to get rockets into space.There are some important things to remember about chemical changes: Arrangement of particles During a chemical change, the particles themselves are changed in some way"
321,"In the example of hydrogen peroxide that was used earlier, the molecules were split up into their component atoms"
322,The number of particles will change because each molecule breaks down into two water molecules () and one oxygen molecule ()
323,Energy changes The energy changes that take place during a chemical reaction are much greater than those that take place during a physical change in matter
324,"During a chemical reaction, energy is used up in order to break bonds and then energy is released when the new product is formed"
325,Reversibility Chemical changes are far more difficult to reverse than physical changes
326,"When hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen, it is almost impossible to get back to hydrogen peroxide"
327,"Mass conservation Mass is conserved during a chemical change, but the number of molecules may change"
328,"In the example of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for every two molecules of hydrogen peroxide that decomposes, three molecules are formed (two water and one oxygen)"
329,"Table 13.1 highlights these concepts for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.Moleculestwo moleculesthree moleculesEnergy changesenergy taken in when bonds are brokenenergy given off when bonds are formedMass is conservedAtoms are conserved oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms Table 13.1: Important concepts in chemical change Exercise 13.1See solutions For each of the following say whether a chemical or a physical change occurs"
330,Melting candle wax.Mixing sodium chloride () and silver nitrate () to form silver chloride ().Mixing hydrochloric acid () and magnesium ribbon () to form magnesium chloride ().Dissolving salt in water.Tearing a piece of magnesium ribbon
331,"As we have already mentioned, a number of changes can occur when elements are combined with one another"
332,One way of representing chemical changes is through balanced chemical equations
333,A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction by using symbols for the elements involved
334,"For example, if we look at the reaction between iron and sulfur to form iron sulfide , we could represent these changes in a sentence, in a word equation or using chemical symbols: Sentence: Iron reacts with sulfur to form iron sulfide"
335,A chemical formula shows each element by its symbol and also shows how many atoms of each element are found in that compound
336,The number of atoms (if greater than one) is shown as a subscript.The following exercise serves as revision
337,"Magnetism is an interaction that allows certain kinds of objects, which are called 'magnetic' objects, to exert forces on each other without physically touching"
338,A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic 'field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object
339,A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object
340,The further away the objects are the weaker the magnetic force will be.Video: VPfkkHumans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years
341,"For example, lodestone is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite"
342,"It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around BCE in Europe and around BCE in Asia.Magnetic objects stuck to a magnetThe root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone."
343,Electrostatics is the study of electric charge which is at rest or static (not moving)
344,In this chapter we will look at some of the basic principles of electrostatics as well as the principle of conservation of charge.Video: VPfmg
345,When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is not in a complete circuit you are measuring the emf of the battery
346,"This is the maximum amount of work per coulomb of charge the battery can do to drive charge from one terminal, through the circuit, to the other terminal.The volt is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827).Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is in a complete circuit you are measuring the terminal potential difference of the battery"
347,Although this is measured in volts it is not identical to the emf
348,The difference will be the work done to drive charge through the battery.BatteriesOne lead of the voltmeter is connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end
349,The voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of a circuit but must be connected in parallel.
350,Many reactions in chemistry and all biological reactions (reactions in living systems) take place in water
351,In this chapter we will look at some of these reactions in detail
352,Almost all the reactions that occur in aqueous solutions involve ions
353,"We will look at three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, namely precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions"
354,"Before we can learn about the types of reactions, we need to first look at ions in aqueous solutions and electrical conductivity.Video: VPbls"
355,"Sometimes it is important to know exactly how many particles (eg atoms or molecules) are in a sample of a substance, or what quantity of a substance is needed for a chemical reaction to take place.The amount of substance is so important in chemistry that it is given its own name, which is the mole.Mole The mole (abbreviation “mol”) is the SI (Standard International) unit for “amount of substance”"
356,The mole is a counting unit just like hours or days
357,We can easily count one second or one minute or one hour
358,"If we want bigger units of time, we refer to days, months and years"
359,"We call this number Avogadro's number.Avogadro's number The number of particles in a mole, equal to"
360,"If we had this number of cold drink cans, then we could cover the surface of the earth to a depth of over"
361,"If you could count atoms at a rate of 10 million per second, then it would take you 2 billion years to count the atoms in one mole!The original hypothesis that was proposed by Amadeo Avogadro was that “equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules”"
362,"His ideas were not accepted by the scientific community and it was only four years after his death, that his original hypothesis was accepted and that it became known as “Avogadro's Law”"
363,"In honour of his contribution to science, the number of particles in one mole was named Avogadro's number.We use Avogadro's number and the mole in chemistry to help us quantify what happens in chemical reaction"
364,If we measure of carbon we have one mole or carbon atoms
365,"You will remember that when the mass, in grams, of an element is equal to its relative atomic mass, the sample contains one mole of that element"
366,This mass is called the molar mass of that element.You may sometimes see the molar mass written as
367,"We will use in this book, but you should be aware of the alternate notation.It is worth remembering the following: On the periodic table, the relative atomic mass that is shown can be interpreted in two ways"
368,"The mass (in grams) of a single, average atom of that element relative to the mass of an atom of carbon"
369,The average atomic mass of all the isotopes of that element
370,"ElementRelative atomic mass (u)Molar mass ()Mass of one mole of the element (g)MagnesiumLithiumOxygenNitrogenIron Table 19.1: The relationship between relative atomic mass, molar mass and the mass of one mole for a number of elements"
371,Calculate the number of moles of iron (Fe) in an sample
372,"If we look at the periodic table, we see that the molar mass of iron is"
373,"This means that 1 mole of iron will have a mass of .If 1 mole of iron has a mass of , then: the number of moles of iron in must be:There are 2 moles of iron in the sample"
374,You need to imagine that the horizontal line is like a division sign and that the vertical line is like a multiplication sign
375,"So, for example, if you want to calculate , then the remaining two letters in the triangle are and and is above with a division sign between them"
376,"Your calculation will then be Remember that when you use the equation , the mass is always in grams (g) and molar mass is in grams per mol ()"
377,Always write the units next to any number you use in a formula or sum
378,Calculate the number of moles of copper there are in a sample that with a mass of
379,Calculate the number of atoms there are in a sample of aluminium that with a mass of
380,"However, you need to remember that all your calculations will apply to the whole compound"
381,"So, when you calculate the molar mass of a covalent compound, you will need to add the molar mass of each atom in that compound"
382,The number of moles will also apply to the whole molecule
383,"For example, if you have one mole of nitric acid () the molar mass is and there are molecules of nitric acid"
384,This is the mass of all the atoms in one formula unit of the compound
385,"For example, one mole of sodium chloride () has a formula mass of and there are molecules of sodium chloride in one formula unit.In a balanced chemical equation, the number that is written in front of the element or compound, shows the mole ratio in which the reactants combine to form a product"
386,"If there are no numbers in front of the element symbol, this means the number is '1'.Video: VPezceg In this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen molecules to produce 2 moles of ammonia molecules"
387,Scalars are physical quantities which have only a number value or a size (magnitude)
388,A scalar tells you how much of something there is.Scalar A scalar is a physical quantity that has only a magnitude (size)
389,"For example, a person buys a tub of margarine which is labelled with a mass of"
390,The mass of the tub of margarine is a scalar quantity
391,"It only needs one number to describe it, in this case, .Vectors are different because they are physical quantities which have a size and a direction"
392,A vector tells you how much of something there is and which direction it is in.Vector A vector is a physical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction
393,"For example, a car is travelling east along a freeway at"
394,The car is moving at (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going – east (this is the direction)
395,Your weight is proportional to your mass (magnitude) and is always in the direction towards the centre of the earth
396,"This chapter is about how things move along a straight line or, more scientifically, how things move in one dimension"
397,This is useful for learning how to describe the movement (motion) of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks
398,There are three features of motion that we use to describe exactly how an object moves
399,They are:The jerk is the name we give to how fast the acceleration is changing.Traffic often moves along a straight line
400,"The word energy comes from the Greek word energeia (ένέργεια), meaning activity or operation"
401,Energy is closely linked to mass and cannot be created or destroyed
402,In this chapter we will consider gravitational potential and kinetic energy.Video: VPgjm
403,"As far as we know, the Earth we live on is the only planet that is able to support life"
404,"Amongst other factors, the Earth is just the right distance from the sun to have temperatures that are suitable for life to exist"
405,"Also, the Earth's atmosphere has exactly the right type of gases in the right amounts for life to survive"
406,"Our planet also has water on its surface, which is something very unique"
407,"In fact, Earth is often called the “Blue Planet” because most of it is covered in water"
408,"This water is made up of freshwater in rivers and lakes, the saltwater of the oceans and estuaries, groundwater and water vapour"
409,"Together, all these water bodies are called the hydrosphere.The EarthVideo: VPbzp"
410,In this chapter learners will explore Newtons three laws of motion and Newtons law of universal gravitation
411,Learners will also learn more about forces and the different kinds of forces
412,The following provides a summary of the topics covered in this chapter.Different kinds of forces
413,"The types of forces covered are: normal force, frictional force, applied force and tension.Force diagrams and free body diagrams"
414,In this section learners will see how to take a problem and draw diagrams to show all the forces acting on a body
415,They will learn what a force diagram is and what a free body diagram is
416,"Each law is covered in detail and practical applications such as rockets, lifts and seat belts are covered"
417,Learners are introduced to the ideas of weight and mass as well as the acceleration due to gravity
418,In this chapter we will learn how a net force is needed to modify the motion of an object
419,We will recall what a force is and learn about how force and motion are related
420,"We are also introduced to Newton's three laws and we will learn more about the force of gravity.Ratio and proportion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skills"
421,Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons to form a chemical bond
422,The outermost orbitals of the atoms overlap so that unpaired electrons in each of the bonding atoms can be shared
423,"By overlapping orbitals, the outer energy shells of all the bonding atoms are filled"
424,"As they move, there is an attraction between these negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei"
425,This attractive force holds the atoms together in a covalent bond
426,Covalent bond A form of chemical bond where pairs of electrons are shared between atoms
427,We will look at a few simple cases to deduce some rules about covalent bonds
428,"Remember that it is only the valence electrons that are involved in bonding, and so when diagrams are drawn to show what is happening during bonding, it is only these electrons that are shown"
429,For this case we will look at hydrogen chloride and methane
430,The electron configuration of hydrogen is and the electron configuration for chlorine is .The hydrogen atom has valence electron and the chlorine atom has valence electrons
431,The Lewis diagrams for hydrogen and chlorine are: Notice the single unpaired electron (highlighted in blue) on each atom
432,"This does not mean this electron is different, we use highlighting here to help you see the unpaired electron"
433,Notice how the two unpaired electrons (one from each atom) form the covalent bond
434,"The dot and cross in between the two atoms, represent the pair of electrons that are shared in the covalent bond"
435,We can also show this bond using a single line: Note how we still show the other electron pairs around chlorine
436,From this we can conclude that any electron on its own will try to pair up with another electron
437,So in practise atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
438,"Remember that we said we can place unpaired electrons at any position (top, bottom, left, right) around the elements symbol"
439,Water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms
440,From what we learnt in the first examples we see that the unpaired electrons can pair up
441,"Instead of writing the Lewis diagram for hydrogen twice, we simply write it once and use the in front of it to indicate that two hydrogens are needed for each oxygen"
442,And now we can answer the questions that we asked before the worked example
443,"We see that oxygen forms two bonds, one with each hydrogen atom"
444,Oxygen however keeps its electron pairs and does not share them
445,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that electron pair
446,A lone pair stays on the atom that it belongs to
447,A lone pair can be used to form a dative covalent bond
448,In the example above the lone pairs on oxygen are highlighted in red
449,When we draw the bonding pairs using lines it is much easier to see the lone pairs on oxygen
450,Notice the two electron pairs between the two oxygen atoms (highlighted in blue)
451,"Because these two covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a double bond"
452,This forms a double covalent bond (which is shown by a double line between the two oxygen atoms)
453,"Hydrogen has valence electron, carbon has valence electrons and nitrogen has valence electrons"
454,Notice the three electron pairs (highlighted in red) between the nitrogen and carbon atom
455,"Because these three covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a triple bond"
456,Nitrogen keeps its electron pair and shares its three unpaired electrons with carbon
457,A dative covalent bond is also known as a coordinate covalent bond
458,Earlier we said that atoms with a pair of electrons will normally not share that pair to form a bond
459,But now we will see how an electron pair can be used by atoms to form a covalent bond
460,One example of a molecule that contains a dative covalent bond is the ammonium ion () shown in the figure below
461,"The hydrogen ion does not contain any electrons, and therefore the electrons that are in the bond that forms between this ion and the nitrogen atom, come only from the nitrogen"
462,Notice that the hydrogen ion is charged and that this charge is shown on the ammonium ion using square brackets and a plus sign outside the square brackets
463,We can also show this as: Note that we do not use a line for the dative covalent bond
464,So in theory atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
465,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that pair to form a bond
466,If an atom has more than one unpaired electron it can form multiple bonds to another atom
467,A dative covalent bond can be formed between an atom with no electrons and an atom with a lone pair
468,There are dots around element Y and from our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we know that these represent the valence electrons
469,X contributes one electron (represented by a cross) to the bond and X has no other electrons
470,From our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we look at how many cross and dot pairs there are in the molecule and that gives us the number of covalent bonds
471,These are single bonds since there is only one dot and cross pair between adjacent atoms
472,Note that Y could also be sulfur and X hydrogen and the molecule would then be hydrogen sulfide (sulfur dihydride)
473,"The types of intermolecular forces that occur in a substance will affect its properties, such as its phase, melting point and boiling point"
474,"You should remember from the kinetic theory of matter (see grade ), that the phase of a substance is determined by how strong the forces are between its particles"
475,"The weaker the forces, the more likely the substance is to exist as a gas"
476,This is because the particles are able to move far apart since they are not held together very strongly
477,"If the forces are very strong, the particles are held closely together in a solid structure"
478,Remember also that the temperature of a material affects the energy of its particles
479,"The more energy the particles have, the more likely they are to be able to overcome the forces that are holding them together"
480,Note that we are showing two dimensional figures when in reality these are three dimensional
481,"The following five experiments investigate the effect of various physical properties (evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling point and capillarity) of substances and determine how these properties relate to intermolecular forces"
482,A formal experiment on the effects of intermolecular forces is included in this chapter
483,"In this experiment learners will investigate how intermolecular forces affect evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling points and capillarity"
484,"Some of the substances that are used (nail polish remover (mainly acetone if you use the non acetone free variety), methylated spirits (a mixture of methanol and ethanol), oil (a mostly non-polar hydrocarbon), glycerin (a fairly complex organic molecule)) are quite complex substances and learners may not have the skills needed to determine the types of intermolecular forces at work here"
485,You should guide learners in this and tell them the intermolecular forces for these substances
486,You can help learners work out the strength of the intermolecular forces by telling them that larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces than smaller molecules
487,This is often a big factor in determining which substance has the strongest intermolecular forces
488,Each experiment focuses on a different property and sees how that property relates to intermolecular forces
489,It will often not be easy for learners to see the small differences between some of the molecules chosen and so they need to use a combination of experimental results and knowledge about the strength of the intermolecular force to try and predict what may happen
490,Each experiment ends with a conclusion about what should be found to guide learners
491,It is very important to work in a well ventilated room (one with lots of air flow) particularly when working with methanol and ethanol
492,"Many of the substances used (particularly nail polish remover, ethanol and methylated spirits) are highly flammable and so care must be taken when heating these substances"
493,It is recommended that learners use a hot plate rather than a Bunsen burner to heat these substances as this reduces the risk of fire
494,"When doing chemistry experiments it is also extra important to ensure that your learners do not run around, do not try to drink the chemicals, do not eat and drink in the lab, do not throw chemicals on the other learners and in general do act in a responsible and safe way"
495,The guidelines for safe experimental work can be found in the science skills chapter from grade
496,From these experiments we can see how intermolecular forces (a microscopic property) affect the macroscopic behaviour of substances
497,If a substance has weak intermolecular forces then it will evaporate easily
498,Substances with weak intermolecular forces also have low surface tension and do not rise as far up in narrow tubes as substances with strong intermolecular forces
499,Substances are more likely to be soluble in liquids with similar intermolecular forces
500,"We will now look at some more properties (molecular size, viscosity, density, melting and boiling points, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity) in detail"
501,The carbon atoms link together to form chains of varying lengths
502,"The boiling point and melting point of these molecules is determined by their molecular structure, and their surface area"
503,"The more carbon atoms there are in an alkane, the greater the surface area and therefore the higher the boiling point"
504,The melting point also increases as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases
505,"there are few carbon atoms), the organic compounds are gases because the intermolecular forces are weak"
506,"As the number of carbon atoms and the molecular mass increases, the compounds are more likely to be liquids or solids because the intermolecular forces are stronger"
507,You should see that the larger a molecule is the stronger the intermolecular forces are between its molecules
508,This is one of the reasons why methane () is a gas at room temperature while pentane () is a liquid and icosane () is a solid
509,"It is partly the stronger intermolecular forces that explain why petrol (mainly octane ()) is a liquid, while candle wax () is a solid"
510,If these intermolecular forces did not increase with increasing molecular size we would not be able to put liquid fuel into our cars or use solid candles
511,Compare how easy it is to pour water and syrup or honey
512,You can see this if you take a cylinder filled with water and a cylinder filled with glycerin
513,Drop a small metal ball into each cylinder and note how easy it is for the ball to fall to the bottom
514,"In the glycerin the ball falls slowly, while in the water it falls faster"
515,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces are more viscous than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
516,The solid phase is often the most dense phase (water is one noteworthy exception to this)
517,This can be explained by the strong intermolecular forces found in a solid
518,These forces pull the molecules together which results in more molecules in one unit volume than in the liquid or gas phases
519,The more molecules in a unit volume the denser that substance will be
520,Substances with weak intermolecular forces will have low melting and boiling points while those with strong intermolecular forces will have high melting and boiling points
521,"In the experiment on intermolecular forces you investigated the boiling points of several substances, and should have seen that molecules with weaker intermolecular forces have a lower boiling point than molecules with stronger intermolecular forces"
522,One further point to note is that covalent network structures (recall from grade that these are covalent compounds that form large networks and an example is diamond) will have high melting and boiling points due to the fact that some bonds (i.e
523,the strong forces between atoms) have to break before the substance can melt
524,"Covalent molecular substances (eg water, sugar) often have lower melting and boiling points, because of the presence of the weaker intermolecular forces holding these molecules together"
525,As the alcohol (or mercury) is heated it expands and rises up the tube
526,This is why when you tile a floor you have to leave gaps between the tiles to allow for expansion
527,It is also why power lines sag slightly and bridges have slight gaps for expansion
528,Heat is transferred through a substance from the point being heated to the other end
529,This is why the bottom of a pot gets hot first (assuming you are heating the pot on a stove plate)
530,"In metals there are some free, delocalised electrons which can help transfer the heat energy through the metal"
531,"In covalent molecular compounds there are no free, delocalised electrons and the heat does not travel as easily through the material"
532,Explain why the melting point of oxygen () is much lower than the melting point of hydrogen chloride
533,"So if a substance has strong intermolecular forces, then that substance will have a high melting point"
534,We know that stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher melting points
535,We also know that oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces than hydrogen chloride (induced dipole versus dipole-dipole forces)
536,Therefore oxygen will have a lower melting point than hydrogen chloride since oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces
537,Induced dipole forces are the weakest intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonding is the strongest
538,In order for a liquid to boil the intermolecular forces must be broken and if the intermolecular forces are very strong then it will take a lot of energy to overcome these forces and so the boiling point will be higher
539,Water has strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) while carbon tetrachloride only has weaker induced dipole forces
540,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces take longer to evaporate than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
541,The type of intermolecular force that can exist when sodium chloride dissolves in methanol is ion-dipole forces
542,The formation of these forces helps to disrupt the ionic bonds in sodium chloride and so sodium chloride can dissolve in methanol
543,Tumi and Jason are helping their dad tile the bathroom floor
544,Their dad tells them to leave small gaps between the tiles
545,Materials (such as tiles) expand on heating and so small gaps need to be left between the tiles to allow for this expansion
546,"If Tumi and Jason did not leave these gaps between the tiles, the tiles would soon lift up"
547,A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of the floor
548,You might draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor
549,"This is not exactly accurate — no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam"
550,"However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically, as we will see in this chapter.We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays"
551,"Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave.We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms"
552,The study of how light interacts with materials is called optics
553,"When dealing with light rays, we are usually interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it"
554,"From these angles, we can determine, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection"
555,"You have learnt about the basic properties of waves before, specifically about reflection and refraction"
556,"In this chapter, you will learn about phenomena that arise with waves in two and three dimensions: diffraction"
557,We will also build on interference which you have learnt about previously but now in more than one dimension.
558,The kinetic theory of matter says that all matter is composed of particles which have a certain amount of energy which allows them to move at different speeds depending on the temperature (energy)
559,There are spaces between the particles and also attractive forces between particles when they come close together.Now we will look at applying the same ideas to gases.The main assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases are as follows: Gases are made up of particles (eg atoms or molecules)
560,The size of these particles is very small compared to the distance between the particles
561,The collisions between particles and the walls of the container do not change the kinetic energy of the system
562,The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
563,From these assumptions we can define the pressure and temperature of any gas.PressureThe pressure of a gas is a measure of the number of collisions of the gas particles with each other and with the sides of the container that they are in.Video: 23VSTemperatureThe temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.If the gas is heated (i.e
564,"the temperature increases), the average kinetic energy of the gas particles will increase and if the temperature is decreased, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases"
565,"If the energy of the particles decreases significantly, the gas liquefies (becomes a liquid).One of the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases is that all particles have a different speed"
566,For an ideal gas we assume that all particles in the gas have the same speed.So for an ideal gas we can simply talk about the speed of particles
567,But for a real gas we must use the average speed of all the particles.Video: 23VT
568,In grade 10 you learnt how to calculate the molar concentration of a solution
569,The molar concentration of a solution is the number of moles of solute per litre of solvent ()
570,"This is more commonly given as moles of solute per cubic decimetre of solution ().To calculate concentration we use , where is the molar concentration, is the number of moles and is the volume of the solution.Calculating molar concentrations is useful to determine how much solute we need to add to a given volume of solvent in order to make a standard solution.A standard solution is a solution in which the concentration is known to a high degree of precision"
571,"When we work with standard solutions we can take the concentration to be constant.When you are busy with these calculations, you will need to remember the following:===, therefore dividing a volume in by will give you the equivalent volume in"
572,How much sodium chloride (in g) will one need to prepare of a standard solution with a concentration of
573,The volume must be converted to : To find the mass of we need the molar mass of
574,We can get this from the periodic table (recall from grade 10 how to calculate the molar mass of a compound).The mass of sodium chloride needed is We will now look at another use of concentration which is for titration calculations.TitrationsA titration is a technique for determining the concentration of an unknown solution
575,Acid-base reactions and redox reactions are both commonly used for titrations.In grade 10 you did a simple acid-base titration
576,Now we will look at how to calculate the concentration of an unknown solution using an acid-base titration.When performing a titration we say that the substance of unknown concentration is titrated with the standard solution
577,A pipette is a measuring device that is used to measure an exact amount of a liquid
578,If you use a pipette to add liquid to a flask then you would say that the liquid was pipetted into a flask.We can reduce the number of calculations that we have to do in titration calculations by using the following: The and are the stoichiometric coefficients of compounds A and B respectively
579,It was found that of the sodium hydroxide was needed to neutralise the acid
580,"Using an acid-base titration, it was found that of this solution was able to completely neutralise of a sodium hydroxide solution"
581,"First convert the volume into :Then calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid:Now we can calculate the concentration of the sulfuric acid:Remember that only or of the sulfuric acid solution is used.Exercise 8.2See solutions Acetylene () burns in oxygen according to the following reaction: If of acetylene gas is burnt, what volume of carbon dioxide will be produced"
582,We first work out what mass of magnesium chloride is needed to make a solution with a concentration of
583,It was found that of the nitric acid was needed to neutralise the base
584,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
585,It was found that of the phosphoric acid was needed to neutralise the base
586,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
587,of this solution is then pipetted into a conical flask and titrated with hydrochloric acid
588,It is found that of the hydrochloric acid completely neutralises the antacid solution
589,Remember that only or of the calcium carbonate solution is used
590,This chapter builds on the work covered in electrostatics in grade 10
591,Learners should be familiar with the two types of charges and with simple calculations of amount of charge
592,The following list summarises the topics covered in this chapter.Coulomb's law In this part of the topic learners are introduced to Coulomb's law
593,This is an inverse square law and has a similar form to Newton's law of Universal Gravitation
594,Electric fields The concept of an electric field is introduced in this part of the chapter
595,Learners will see how to draw the electric field lines for different configurations of charges and will learn how to determine the magnitude of the electric field
596,Learners will also learn how to calculate the electric field at a point due to a number of point charges
597,"In this chapter you will learn exactly how to determine this force and about a basic law of electrostatics.Ratio and proportion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsScientific notation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skills"
598,This chapter takes the ideas of magnetism and the ideas of electricity and combines them into one
599,The following list summarises the topics covered in this chapter.Magnetic fields are associated with current carrying wires The idea that magnetism and electricity are linked is introduced
600,The concept of a magnetic field around a current carrying wire is explored and a simple method to determine the direction of the magnetic field is explained
601,Faraday's law Faraday's law relates the emf produced to the magnetic flux around a loop of conductor
602,The concept of electromagnetic induction is introduced and some simple calculations using Faraday's law are shown
603,"Electromagnetism describes the interaction between charges, currents and the electric and magnetic fields to which they give rise"
604,An electric current creates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field will create a flow of charge
605,"This has resulted in the invention of many devices which are useful to humans, for example cellular telephones, microwave ovens, radios, televisions and many more."
606,The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in the real-world
607,We depend on electricity and electrical appliances to make many things possible in our daily lives
608,"This becomes very clear when there is a power failure and we can't use the kettle to boil water for tea or coffee, can't use the stove or oven to cook dinner, can't charge our cellphone batteries, watch TV, or use electric lights.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesGraphs - Mathematics, Grade 10, Functions and graphs"
609,"When a chemical reaction occurs, bonds in the reactants break, while new bonds form in the product"
610,"Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, according to the following equation:In this reaction, the bond between the two hydrogen atoms in the molecule will break, as will the bond between the oxygen atoms in the molecule"
611,"New bonds will form between the two hydrogen atoms and the single oxygen atom in the water molecule that is formed as the product.For bonds to break, energy must be absorbed"
612,The energy that is needed to break a bond is called the bond energy or bond dissociation energy
613,Bond energies are measured in units of .Bond energy Bond energy is a measure of bond strength in a chemical bond
614,It is the amount of energy (in ) that is needed to break the chemical bond between two atoms
615,Remember when we discussed bonding (chapter 3) we used the following energy diagram:We can use this diagram to understand why bond breaking requires energy and bond making releases energy
616,"When a bond breaks, the atoms move apart and the distance between them increases (i.e"
617,the atom moves to the right on the -axis or from point X to point A)
618,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy increases (i.e"
619,the energy at point A is greater than the energy at point X)
620,So when a bond breaks energy is needed.When a bond forms the atoms move closer together and the distance between them decreases (i.e
621,the atom moves to the left on the -axis or from point A to point X)
622,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy decreases (i.e"
623,the energy at point X is less than the energy at point A)
624,So when a bond forms energy is released.Looking at the example of hydrogen reacting with oxygen to form water:We see that energy is needed to break the bonds in the hydrogen molecule and to break the bonds in the oxygen molecule)
625,And we also see that energy is released when hydrogen and oxygen bond to form water)
626,"When we look at the entire reaction and consider both bond breaking and bond forming we need to look at the enthalpy of the system.Enthalpy Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a chemical system for a given pressure, and is given the symbol H"
627,A chemical system is a closed system that contains only the reactants and products involved in the reaction.As we learn about exothermic and endothermic reactions we will see more on the concept of enthalpy.
628,Up to now you have looked at reactions as starting with the reactants and going to the products
629,For acids and bases we also need to consider what happens if we swop the reactants and the products around
630,And that when (the base) gains a proton it forms (the acid)
631,In your own words explain what is meant by the term conjugate acid-base pair
632,A conjugate acid-base pair is a reactant and product pair that is transformed into each other through the loss or gain of a proton
633,So for example an acid loses a proton to form a base
634,The acid and the resulting base are said to be a conjugate acid-base pair
635,This chapter looks at the lithosphere and explores mining in more detail
636,"Mining is very important in South Africa as a large part of the economy depends on gold, diamond and coal mining"
637,"This chapter looks at the history of mankind, what the lithosphere is, what is in the lithosphere and then goes on to look at mining"
638,The general techniques used across all types of mining are looked at and then gold mining is explored in greater detail
639,Learners can do the mining section as a project (either in groups or individually) that they then present to the class
640,"If learners do a project ensure that each mineral listed in CAPs (iron, phosphate, coal, diamond, copper, platinum, zinc, chrome, asbestos, manganese and gold) is covered by at least one learner in the class.This topic provides a great opportunity to look at social justice and economic concerns"
641,The various class discussions and debates provided give learners the chance to think about some critical issues in South Africa.In Grade 10 we studied the elements
642,We learnt about the different elements and the compounds that could be formed from those elements
643,Where did mankind find them and how has he used them?This chapter will explore the part of the Earth known as the lithosphere
644,We will find out what the lithosphere is and how the elements are distributed within it.
645,"All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of matter"
646,"Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us"
647,Even our own human bodies are made of matter!Different objects can be made of different types of materials (the matter from which objects are made)
648,"For example, a cupboard (an object) is made of wood, nails, hinges and knobs (the materials)"
649,The properties of the materials will affect the properties of the object
650,"In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable"
651,"Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes (eg clay, dough)"
652,Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires (eg copper)
653,The boiling and melting points of substances tells us the temperature at which the substance will boil or melt
654,"This helps us to classify substances as solids, liquids or gases at a specific temperature"
655,The diagram below shows one way in which matter can be classified (grouped) according to its different properties
656,"As you read further in this chapter, you will see that there are also other ways of classifying materials, for example according to whether or not they are good electrical conductors."
657,In this chapter we will explore the states of matter and then look at the kinetic molecular theory
658,We will also examine how the kinetic theory of matter helps explain boiling and melting points as well as other properties of matter
659,Diffusion can be seen as a spreading out of particles resulting in an even distribution of the particles
660,You can see diffusion when you place a drop of food colouring in water
661,"If matter were not made of particles that are constantly moving then we would only see a clump of colour when we put the food colouring in water, as there would be nothing that could move about and mix in with the water"
662,"In 1828 Robert Brown observed that pollen grains suspended in water moved about in a rapid, irregular motion"
663,Brownian motion can also be seen as the random to and fro movement of particles
664,"Matter exists in one of three states, namely solid, liquid and gas"
665,A liquid takes on the shape of the container that it is in
666,Matter can change between these states by either adding heat or removing heat
667,As we heat an object (eg water) it goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas
668,Evaporation from a liquid's surface can happen at a wide range of temperatures
669,If more energy is added then bubbles of gas appear inside the liquid and this is known as boiling
670,Sublimation is the process of going from a solid to a gas
671,Deposition is the process of going from a gas to a solid
672,"If we know the melting and boiling point of a substance then we can say what state (solid, liquid or gas) it will be in at any temperature"
673,A heating curve of a substance gives the changes in temperature as we move from a solid to a liquid to a gas
674,A cooling curve gives the changes in temperature as we move from gas to liquid to solid
675,"An important observation is that as a substance melts or boils, the temperature remains constant until the substance has changed state"
676,This is because all the heat energy goes into breaking or forming the bonds between the molecules
677,The following diagrams give examples of what heating and cooling curves look like:
678,We have now looked at many examples of the types of matter and materials that exist around us and we have investigated some of the ways that materials are classified
679,"In order to understand this, we need to take a closer look at the building blocks of matter — the atom"
680,Atoms are the basis of all the structures and organisms in the universe
681,"The planets, sun, grass, trees, air we breathe and people are all made up of different combinations of atoms.Video: VPrkk"
682,The periodic table of the elements is a method of showing the chemical elements in a table with the elements arranged in order of increasing atomic number
683,Most of the work that was done to arrive at the periodic table that we know can be attributed to a Russian chemist named Dmitri Mendeleev
684,Mendeleev designed the table in 1869 in such a way that recurring (periodic) trends or patterns in the properties of the elements could be shown
685,"Using the trends he observed, he left gaps for those elements that he thought were “missing”"
686,He also predicted the properties that he thought the missing elements would have when they were discovered
687,Many of these elements were indeed discovered and Mendeleev's predictions were proved to be correct
688,"To show the recurring properties that he had observed, Mendeleev began new rows in his table so that elements with similar properties were in the same vertical columns, called groups"
689,The full periodic table is reproduced at the front of this book
690,"These are the energies needed to remove the second, third, or fourth electron respectively"
691,"If you look at a periodic table, you will see the groups numbered at the top of each column"
692,The groups are numbered from left to right starting with 1 and ending with 18
693,This is the convention that we will use in this book
694,"On some periodic tables you may see that the groups are numbered from left to right as follows: 1, 2, then an open space which contains the transition elements, followed by groups 3 to 8"
695,A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table of the elements
696,"The periods are labelled from top to bottom, starting with 1 and ending with 7"
697,For each element on the periodic table we can give its period number and its group number
698,We can also determine the electronic structure of an element from its position on the periodic table
699,In Chapter 4 you worked out the electronic configuration of various elements
700,Using the periodic table we can easily give the electronic configurations of any element
701,"For example, phosphorus () is in the third period and group 15"
702,"Looking at the figure above, we see that the p-orbital is being filled"
703,Similar trends are observed in the other periods of the periodic table
704,The chlorides are compounds with chlorine and the oxides are compounds with oxygen
705,"no oxides, but fluorine does combine with oxygen in compounds called oxygen fluorides"
706,Draw a line graph to show the relationship between atomic number (on the x-axis) and ionisation energy (y-axis)
707,A chemical bond is formed when atoms are held together by attractive forces
708,"This attraction occurs when electrons are shared between atoms, or when electrons are exchanged between the atoms that are involved in the bond"
709,"The sharing or exchange of electrons takes place so that the outer energy levels of the atoms involved are filled, making the atoms are more stable"
710,"If an electron is shared, it means that it will spend its time moving in the electron orbitals around both atoms"
711,If an electron is exchanged it means that it is transferred from one atom to another
712,In other words one atom gains an electron while the other loses an electron.Chemical bond A chemical bond is the physical process that causes atoms and molecules to be attracted to each other and held together in more stable chemical compounds
713,The type of bond that is formed depends on the elements that are involved
714,"In this chapter, we will be looking at three types of chemical bonding: covalent, ionic and metallic bonding.You need to remember that it is the valence electrons (those in the outermost level) that are involved in bonding and that atoms will try to fill their outer energy levels so that they are more stable"
715,"The noble gases have completely full outer energy levels, so are very stable and do not react easily with other atoms."
716,A medium is the substance or material through which a pulse moves
717,The medium does not create the pulse and the medium is not the pulse
718,"Therefore the medium does not travel with the pulse as the pulse moves through it.In each medium, the particles that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest position"
719,"In order for a pulse to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other.Medium A medium is the substance or material in which a pulse will move"
720,"The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket"
721,"All waves have the same properties.Waves do not only occur in water, they occur in any kind of medium"
722,Earthquakes release enough energy to create waves that are powerful enough to travel through the rock of the Earth
723,When your friend speaks to you sound waves are produced that travel through the air to your ears
724,A wave is simply the disturbance of a medium by moving energy but how is it different from a pulse?
725,Longitudinal waves A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
726,When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave itself
727,We will do the same for longitudinal waves.The question is how do we construct such a wave?A longitudinal wave is seen best in a slinky spring
728,Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves parallel to the direction in which the spring was pulled
729,The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium
730,"The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave.Video: VPdkfAs in the case of transverse waves the following properties can be defined for longitudinal waves:wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed."
731,A tuning fork is an instrument used by musicians to create sound waves of a specific frequency
732,They are often used to tune musical instruments.Sound waves coming from a tuning fork are caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork which push against the air particles in front of it
733,As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed
734,The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction
735,"As the particles continue to push against each other, the sound wave travels through the air"
736,"Due to this motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air"
737,"This means that in media where the particles are closer together, sound waves will travel faster.Tuning forkSound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together)"
738,Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids.A sound wave is a pressure wave
739,This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates
740,These compressions and rarefactions arise because the source vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.
741,The most common example of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is visible light
742,"Everyone is very familiar with light in everyday life, you can only see things because light bounces off them and enters your eyes"
743,This alone makes it worthwhile to learn about it but there are also very many other applications of EM radiation
744,It is called electromagnetic because there are electric and magnetic fields making up the radiation
745,"We will look at this in more detail a little later.In everyday experience, light doesn't seem to have many special properties but it does: A huge spectrum: The light we can see (visible EM radiation) is only a small part of all of the EM radiation (electromagnetic spectrum) that exists"
746,Nature's speed limit: Nothing moves faster than the speed of light
747,Wave nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a wave which we call wave-like behaviour
748,Particle nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a particle which we call particle-like behaviour
749,No medium required: EM radiation can propagate without a medium through which to move even though they are waves
750,We will discuss this in the following sections and in even more detail in Grades 11 and 12.
751,Diagrams of compounds are very useful because they help us to picture how the atoms are arranged in the compound and they help us to see the shape of the compound
752,"There are three types of diagrams that are commonly used: Wireframe or stick models In this model, the bonds between atoms are shown as “sticks”"
753,Ball and stick models This is a 3-dimensional molecular model that uses “balls” to represent atoms and “sticks” to represent the bonds between them
754,The centres of the atoms (the balls) are connected by straight lines which represent the bonds between them
755,Table 12.1 shows examples of the different types of models for all the types of compounds.Covalent molecularCovalent networkIonic networkMetallic networkName of compoundglucosegraphitesilver chloridezincFormula or Stick modelBall-and-stick modelSpace-filling model Table 12.1: Different representations for compounds CanvasMol (www.alteredqualia.com/canvasmol) is a website that allows you to view several compounds
756,"You do not need to know these compounds, this is simply to allow you to see one way of representing compounds."
757,The synthesis (forming) of water () from hydrogen gas () and oxygen gas () is another example of chemical change
758,A simplified diagram of this reaction is shown in Figure 13.3
759,The chemical bonds between in and between in are broken and new bonds between and (to form ) are formed
760,"A chemical change has taken place.Video: VPbhyA mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas is used as a fuel to get rockets into space.There are some important things to remember about chemical changes: Arrangement of particles During a chemical change, the particles themselves are changed in some way"
761,"In the example of hydrogen peroxide that was used earlier, the molecules were split up into their component atoms"
762,The number of particles will change because each molecule breaks down into two water molecules () and one oxygen molecule ()
763,Energy changes The energy changes that take place during a chemical reaction are much greater than those that take place during a physical change in matter
764,"During a chemical reaction, energy is used up in order to break bonds and then energy is released when the new product is formed"
765,Reversibility Chemical changes are far more difficult to reverse than physical changes
766,"When hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen, it is almost impossible to get back to hydrogen peroxide"
767,"Mass conservation Mass is conserved during a chemical change, but the number of molecules may change"
768,"In the example of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for every two molecules of hydrogen peroxide that decomposes, three molecules are formed (two water and one oxygen)"
769,"Table 13.1 highlights these concepts for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.Moleculestwo moleculesthree moleculesEnergy changesenergy taken in when bonds are brokenenergy given off when bonds are formedMass is conservedAtoms are conserved oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms Table 13.1: Important concepts in chemical change Exercise 13.1See solutions For each of the following say whether a chemical or a physical change occurs"
770,Melting candle wax.Mixing sodium chloride () and silver nitrate () to form silver chloride ().Mixing hydrochloric acid () and magnesium ribbon () to form magnesium chloride ().Dissolving salt in water.Tearing a piece of magnesium ribbon
771,"As we have already mentioned, a number of changes can occur when elements are combined with one another"
772,One way of representing chemical changes is through balanced chemical equations
773,A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction by using symbols for the elements involved
774,"For example, if we look at the reaction between iron and sulfur to form iron sulfide , we could represent these changes in a sentence, in a word equation or using chemical symbols: Sentence: Iron reacts with sulfur to form iron sulfide"
775,A chemical formula shows each element by its symbol and also shows how many atoms of each element are found in that compound
776,The number of atoms (if greater than one) is shown as a subscript.The following exercise serves as revision
777,"Magnetism is an interaction that allows certain kinds of objects, which are called 'magnetic' objects, to exert forces on each other without physically touching"
778,A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic 'field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object
779,A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object
780,The further away the objects are the weaker the magnetic force will be.Video: VPfkkHumans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years
781,"For example, lodestone is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite"
782,"It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around BCE in Europe and around BCE in Asia.Magnetic objects stuck to a magnetThe root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone."
783,Electrostatics is the study of electric charge which is at rest or static (not moving)
784,In this chapter we will look at some of the basic principles of electrostatics as well as the principle of conservation of charge.Video: VPfmg
785,When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is not in a complete circuit you are measuring the emf of the battery
786,"This is the maximum amount of work per coulomb of charge the battery can do to drive charge from one terminal, through the circuit, to the other terminal.The volt is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827).Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is in a complete circuit you are measuring the terminal potential difference of the battery"
787,Although this is measured in volts it is not identical to the emf
788,The difference will be the work done to drive charge through the battery.BatteriesOne lead of the voltmeter is connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end
789,The voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of a circuit but must be connected in parallel.
790,Many reactions in chemistry and all biological reactions (reactions in living systems) take place in water
791,In this chapter we will look at some of these reactions in detail
792,Almost all the reactions that occur in aqueous solutions involve ions
793,"We will look at three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, namely precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions"
794,"Before we can learn about the types of reactions, we need to first look at ions in aqueous solutions and electrical conductivity.Video: VPbls"
795,"Sometimes it is important to know exactly how many particles (eg atoms or molecules) are in a sample of a substance, or what quantity of a substance is needed for a chemical reaction to take place.The amount of substance is so important in chemistry that it is given its own name, which is the mole.Mole The mole (abbreviation “mol”) is the SI (Standard International) unit for “amount of substance”"
796,The mole is a counting unit just like hours or days
797,We can easily count one second or one minute or one hour
798,"If we want bigger units of time, we refer to days, months and years"
799,"We call this number Avogadro's number.Avogadro's number The number of particles in a mole, equal to"
800,"If we had this number of cold drink cans, then we could cover the surface of the earth to a depth of over"
801,"If you could count atoms at a rate of 10 million per second, then it would take you 2 billion years to count the atoms in one mole!The original hypothesis that was proposed by Amadeo Avogadro was that “equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules”"
802,"His ideas were not accepted by the scientific community and it was only four years after his death, that his original hypothesis was accepted and that it became known as “Avogadro's Law”"
803,"In honour of his contribution to science, the number of particles in one mole was named Avogadro's number.We use Avogadro's number and the mole in chemistry to help us quantify what happens in chemical reaction"
804,If we measure of carbon we have one mole or carbon atoms
805,"You will remember that when the mass, in grams, of an element is equal to its relative atomic mass, the sample contains one mole of that element"
806,This mass is called the molar mass of that element.You may sometimes see the molar mass written as
807,"We will use in this book, but you should be aware of the alternate notation.It is worth remembering the following: On the periodic table, the relative atomic mass that is shown can be interpreted in two ways"
808,"The mass (in grams) of a single, average atom of that element relative to the mass of an atom of carbon"
809,The average atomic mass of all the isotopes of that element
810,"ElementRelative atomic mass (u)Molar mass ()Mass of one mole of the element (g)MagnesiumLithiumOxygenNitrogenIron Table 19.1: The relationship between relative atomic mass, molar mass and the mass of one mole for a number of elements"
811,Calculate the number of moles of iron (Fe) in an sample
812,"If we look at the periodic table, we see that the molar mass of iron is"
813,"This means that 1 mole of iron will have a mass of .If 1 mole of iron has a mass of , then: the number of moles of iron in must be:There are 2 moles of iron in the sample"
814,You need to imagine that the horizontal line is like a division sign and that the vertical line is like a multiplication sign
815,"So, for example, if you want to calculate , then the remaining two letters in the triangle are and and is above with a division sign between them"
816,"Your calculation will then be Remember that when you use the equation , the mass is always in grams (g) and molar mass is in grams per mol ()"
817,Always write the units next to any number you use in a formula or sum
818,Calculate the number of moles of copper there are in a sample that with a mass of
819,Calculate the number of atoms there are in a sample of aluminium that with a mass of
820,"However, you need to remember that all your calculations will apply to the whole compound"
821,"So, when you calculate the molar mass of a covalent compound, you will need to add the molar mass of each atom in that compound"
822,The number of moles will also apply to the whole molecule
823,"For example, if you have one mole of nitric acid () the molar mass is and there are molecules of nitric acid"
824,This is the mass of all the atoms in one formula unit of the compound
825,"For example, one mole of sodium chloride () has a formula mass of and there are molecules of sodium chloride in one formula unit.In a balanced chemical equation, the number that is written in front of the element or compound, shows the mole ratio in which the reactants combine to form a product"
826,"If there are no numbers in front of the element symbol, this means the number is '1'.Video: VPezceg In this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen molecules to produce 2 moles of ammonia molecules"
827,Scalars are physical quantities which have only a number value or a size (magnitude)
828,A scalar tells you how much of something there is.Scalar A scalar is a physical quantity that has only a magnitude (size)
829,"For example, a person buys a tub of margarine which is labelled with a mass of"
830,The mass of the tub of margarine is a scalar quantity
831,"It only needs one number to describe it, in this case, .Vectors are different because they are physical quantities which have a size and a direction"
832,A vector tells you how much of something there is and which direction it is in.Vector A vector is a physical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction
833,"For example, a car is travelling east along a freeway at"
834,The car is moving at (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going – east (this is the direction)
835,Your weight is proportional to your mass (magnitude) and is always in the direction towards the centre of the earth
836,"This chapter is about how things move along a straight line or, more scientifically, how things move in one dimension"
837,This is useful for learning how to describe the movement (motion) of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks
838,There are three features of motion that we use to describe exactly how an object moves
839,They are:The jerk is the name we give to how fast the acceleration is changing.Traffic often moves along a straight line
840,"The word energy comes from the Greek word energeia (ένέργεια), meaning activity or operation"
841,Energy is closely linked to mass and cannot be created or destroyed
842,In this chapter we will consider gravitational potential and kinetic energy.Video: VPgjm
843,"As far as we know, the Earth we live on is the only planet that is able to support life"
844,"Amongst other factors, the Earth is just the right distance from the sun to have temperatures that are suitable for life to exist"
845,"Also, the Earth's atmosphere has exactly the right type of gases in the right amounts for life to survive"
846,"Our planet also has water on its surface, which is something very unique"
847,"In fact, Earth is often called the “Blue Planet” because most of it is covered in water"
848,"This water is made up of freshwater in rivers and lakes, the saltwater of the oceans and estuaries, groundwater and water vapour"
849,"Together, all these water bodies are called the hydrosphere.The EarthVideo: VPbzp"
850,In this chapter learners will explore Newtons three laws of motion and Newtons law of universal gravitation
851,Learners will also learn more about forces and the different kinds of forces
852,The following provides a summary of the topics covered in this chapter.Different kinds of forces
853,"The types of forces covered are: normal force, frictional force, applied force and tension.Force diagrams and free body diagrams"
854,In this section learners will see how to take a problem and draw diagrams to show all the forces acting on a body
855,They will learn what a force diagram is and what a free body diagram is
856,"Each law is covered in detail and practical applications such as rockets, lifts and seat belts are covered"
857,Learners are introduced to the ideas of weight and mass as well as the acceleration due to gravity
858,In this chapter we will learn how a net force is needed to modify the motion of an object
859,We will recall what a force is and learn about how force and motion are related
860,"We are also introduced to Newton's three laws and we will learn more about the force of gravity.Ratio and proportion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skills"
861,Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons to form a chemical bond
862,The outermost orbitals of the atoms overlap so that unpaired electrons in each of the bonding atoms can be shared
863,"By overlapping orbitals, the outer energy shells of all the bonding atoms are filled"
864,"As they move, there is an attraction between these negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei"
865,This attractive force holds the atoms together in a covalent bond
866,Covalent bond A form of chemical bond where pairs of electrons are shared between atoms
867,We will look at a few simple cases to deduce some rules about covalent bonds
868,"Remember that it is only the valence electrons that are involved in bonding, and so when diagrams are drawn to show what is happening during bonding, it is only these electrons that are shown"
869,For this case we will look at hydrogen chloride and methane
870,The electron configuration of hydrogen is and the electron configuration for chlorine is .The hydrogen atom has valence electron and the chlorine atom has valence electrons
871,The Lewis diagrams for hydrogen and chlorine are: Notice the single unpaired electron (highlighted in blue) on each atom
872,"This does not mean this electron is different, we use highlighting here to help you see the unpaired electron"
873,Notice how the two unpaired electrons (one from each atom) form the covalent bond
874,"The dot and cross in between the two atoms, represent the pair of electrons that are shared in the covalent bond"
875,We can also show this bond using a single line: Note how we still show the other electron pairs around chlorine
876,From this we can conclude that any electron on its own will try to pair up with another electron
877,So in practise atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
878,"Remember that we said we can place unpaired electrons at any position (top, bottom, left, right) around the elements symbol"
879,Water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms
880,From what we learnt in the first examples we see that the unpaired electrons can pair up
881,"Instead of writing the Lewis diagram for hydrogen twice, we simply write it once and use the in front of it to indicate that two hydrogens are needed for each oxygen"
882,And now we can answer the questions that we asked before the worked example
883,"We see that oxygen forms two bonds, one with each hydrogen atom"
884,Oxygen however keeps its electron pairs and does not share them
885,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that electron pair
886,A lone pair stays on the atom that it belongs to
887,A lone pair can be used to form a dative covalent bond
888,In the example above the lone pairs on oxygen are highlighted in red
889,When we draw the bonding pairs using lines it is much easier to see the lone pairs on oxygen
890,Notice the two electron pairs between the two oxygen atoms (highlighted in blue)
891,"Because these two covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a double bond"
892,This forms a double covalent bond (which is shown by a double line between the two oxygen atoms)
893,"Hydrogen has valence electron, carbon has valence electrons and nitrogen has valence electrons"
894,Notice the three electron pairs (highlighted in red) between the nitrogen and carbon atom
895,"Because these three covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a triple bond"
896,Nitrogen keeps its electron pair and shares its three unpaired electrons with carbon
897,A dative covalent bond is also known as a coordinate covalent bond
898,Earlier we said that atoms with a pair of electrons will normally not share that pair to form a bond
899,But now we will see how an electron pair can be used by atoms to form a covalent bond
900,One example of a molecule that contains a dative covalent bond is the ammonium ion () shown in the figure below
901,"The hydrogen ion does not contain any electrons, and therefore the electrons that are in the bond that forms between this ion and the nitrogen atom, come only from the nitrogen"
902,Notice that the hydrogen ion is charged and that this charge is shown on the ammonium ion using square brackets and a plus sign outside the square brackets
903,We can also show this as: Note that we do not use a line for the dative covalent bond
904,So in theory atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
905,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that pair to form a bond
906,If an atom has more than one unpaired electron it can form multiple bonds to another atom
907,A dative covalent bond can be formed between an atom with no electrons and an atom with a lone pair
908,There are dots around element Y and from our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we know that these represent the valence electrons
909,X contributes one electron (represented by a cross) to the bond and X has no other electrons
910,From our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we look at how many cross and dot pairs there are in the molecule and that gives us the number of covalent bonds
911,These are single bonds since there is only one dot and cross pair between adjacent atoms
912,Note that Y could also be sulfur and X hydrogen and the molecule would then be hydrogen sulfide (sulfur dihydride)
913,"The types of intermolecular forces that occur in a substance will affect its properties, such as its phase, melting point and boiling point"
914,"You should remember from the kinetic theory of matter (see grade ), that the phase of a substance is determined by how strong the forces are between its particles"
915,"The weaker the forces, the more likely the substance is to exist as a gas"
916,This is because the particles are able to move far apart since they are not held together very strongly
917,"If the forces are very strong, the particles are held closely together in a solid structure"
918,Remember also that the temperature of a material affects the energy of its particles
919,"The more energy the particles have, the more likely they are to be able to overcome the forces that are holding them together"
920,Note that we are showing two dimensional figures when in reality these are three dimensional
921,"The following five experiments investigate the effect of various physical properties (evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling point and capillarity) of substances and determine how these properties relate to intermolecular forces"
922,A formal experiment on the effects of intermolecular forces is included in this chapter
923,"In this experiment learners will investigate how intermolecular forces affect evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling points and capillarity"
924,"Some of the substances that are used (nail polish remover (mainly acetone if you use the non acetone free variety), methylated spirits (a mixture of methanol and ethanol), oil (a mostly non-polar hydrocarbon), glycerin (a fairly complex organic molecule)) are quite complex substances and learners may not have the skills needed to determine the types of intermolecular forces at work here"
925,You should guide learners in this and tell them the intermolecular forces for these substances
926,You can help learners work out the strength of the intermolecular forces by telling them that larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces than smaller molecules
927,This is often a big factor in determining which substance has the strongest intermolecular forces
928,Each experiment focuses on a different property and sees how that property relates to intermolecular forces
929,It will often not be easy for learners to see the small differences between some of the molecules chosen and so they need to use a combination of experimental results and knowledge about the strength of the intermolecular force to try and predict what may happen
930,Each experiment ends with a conclusion about what should be found to guide learners
931,It is very important to work in a well ventilated room (one with lots of air flow) particularly when working with methanol and ethanol
932,"Many of the substances used (particularly nail polish remover, ethanol and methylated spirits) are highly flammable and so care must be taken when heating these substances"
933,It is recommended that learners use a hot plate rather than a Bunsen burner to heat these substances as this reduces the risk of fire
934,"When doing chemistry experiments it is also extra important to ensure that your learners do not run around, do not try to drink the chemicals, do not eat and drink in the lab, do not throw chemicals on the other learners and in general do act in a responsible and safe way"
935,The guidelines for safe experimental work can be found in the science skills chapter from grade
936,From these experiments we can see how intermolecular forces (a microscopic property) affect the macroscopic behaviour of substances
937,If a substance has weak intermolecular forces then it will evaporate easily
938,Substances with weak intermolecular forces also have low surface tension and do not rise as far up in narrow tubes as substances with strong intermolecular forces
939,Substances are more likely to be soluble in liquids with similar intermolecular forces
940,"We will now look at some more properties (molecular size, viscosity, density, melting and boiling points, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity) in detail"
941,The carbon atoms link together to form chains of varying lengths
942,"The boiling point and melting point of these molecules is determined by their molecular structure, and their surface area"
943,"The more carbon atoms there are in an alkane, the greater the surface area and therefore the higher the boiling point"
944,The melting point also increases as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases
945,"there are few carbon atoms), the organic compounds are gases because the intermolecular forces are weak"
946,"As the number of carbon atoms and the molecular mass increases, the compounds are more likely to be liquids or solids because the intermolecular forces are stronger"
947,You should see that the larger a molecule is the stronger the intermolecular forces are between its molecules
948,This is one of the reasons why methane () is a gas at room temperature while pentane () is a liquid and icosane () is a solid
949,"It is partly the stronger intermolecular forces that explain why petrol (mainly octane ()) is a liquid, while candle wax () is a solid"
950,If these intermolecular forces did not increase with increasing molecular size we would not be able to put liquid fuel into our cars or use solid candles
951,Compare how easy it is to pour water and syrup or honey
952,You can see this if you take a cylinder filled with water and a cylinder filled with glycerin
953,Drop a small metal ball into each cylinder and note how easy it is for the ball to fall to the bottom
954,"In the glycerin the ball falls slowly, while in the water it falls faster"
955,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces are more viscous than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
956,The solid phase is often the most dense phase (water is one noteworthy exception to this)
957,This can be explained by the strong intermolecular forces found in a solid
958,These forces pull the molecules together which results in more molecules in one unit volume than in the liquid or gas phases
959,The more molecules in a unit volume the denser that substance will be
960,Substances with weak intermolecular forces will have low melting and boiling points while those with strong intermolecular forces will have high melting and boiling points
961,"In the experiment on intermolecular forces you investigated the boiling points of several substances, and should have seen that molecules with weaker intermolecular forces have a lower boiling point than molecules with stronger intermolecular forces"
962,One further point to note is that covalent network structures (recall from grade that these are covalent compounds that form large networks and an example is diamond) will have high melting and boiling points due to the fact that some bonds (i.e
963,the strong forces between atoms) have to break before the substance can melt
964,"Covalent molecular substances (eg water, sugar) often have lower melting and boiling points, because of the presence of the weaker intermolecular forces holding these molecules together"
965,As the alcohol (or mercury) is heated it expands and rises up the tube
966,This is why when you tile a floor you have to leave gaps between the tiles to allow for expansion
967,It is also why power lines sag slightly and bridges have slight gaps for expansion
968,Heat is transferred through a substance from the point being heated to the other end
969,This is why the bottom of a pot gets hot first (assuming you are heating the pot on a stove plate)
970,"In metals there are some free, delocalised electrons which can help transfer the heat energy through the metal"
971,"In covalent molecular compounds there are no free, delocalised electrons and the heat does not travel as easily through the material"
972,Explain why the melting point of oxygen () is much lower than the melting point of hydrogen chloride
973,"So if a substance has strong intermolecular forces, then that substance will have a high melting point"
974,We know that stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher melting points
975,We also know that oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces than hydrogen chloride (induced dipole versus dipole-dipole forces)
976,Therefore oxygen will have a lower melting point than hydrogen chloride since oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces
977,Induced dipole forces are the weakest intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonding is the strongest
978,In order for a liquid to boil the intermolecular forces must be broken and if the intermolecular forces are very strong then it will take a lot of energy to overcome these forces and so the boiling point will be higher
979,Water has strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) while carbon tetrachloride only has weaker induced dipole forces
980,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces take longer to evaporate than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
981,The type of intermolecular force that can exist when sodium chloride dissolves in methanol is ion-dipole forces
982,The formation of these forces helps to disrupt the ionic bonds in sodium chloride and so sodium chloride can dissolve in methanol
983,Tumi and Jason are helping their dad tile the bathroom floor
984,Their dad tells them to leave small gaps between the tiles
985,Materials (such as tiles) expand on heating and so small gaps need to be left between the tiles to allow for this expansion
986,"If Tumi and Jason did not leave these gaps between the tiles, the tiles would soon lift up"
987,A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of the floor
988,You might draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor
989,"This is not exactly accurate — no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam"
990,"However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically, as we will see in this chapter.We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays"
991,"Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave.We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms"
992,The study of how light interacts with materials is called optics
993,"When dealing with light rays, we are usually interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it"
994,"From these angles, we can determine, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection"
995,"You have learnt about the basic properties of waves before, specifically about reflection and refraction"
996,"In this chapter, you will learn about phenomena that arise with waves in two and three dimensions: diffraction"
997,We will also build on interference which you have learnt about previously but now in more than one dimension.
998,The kinetic theory of matter says that all matter is composed of particles which have a certain amount of energy which allows them to move at different speeds depending on the temperature (energy)
999,There are spaces between the particles and also attractive forces between particles when they come close together.Now we will look at applying the same ideas to gases.The main assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases are as follows: Gases are made up of particles (eg atoms or molecules)
1000,The size of these particles is very small compared to the distance between the particles
1001,The collisions between particles and the walls of the container do not change the kinetic energy of the system
1002,The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
1003,From these assumptions we can define the pressure and temperature of any gas.PressureThe pressure of a gas is a measure of the number of collisions of the gas particles with each other and with the sides of the container that they are in.Video: 23VSTemperatureThe temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.If the gas is heated (i.e
1004,"the temperature increases), the average kinetic energy of the gas particles will increase and if the temperature is decreased, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases"
1005,"If the energy of the particles decreases significantly, the gas liquefies (becomes a liquid).One of the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases is that all particles have a different speed"
1006,For an ideal gas we assume that all particles in the gas have the same speed.So for an ideal gas we can simply talk about the speed of particles
1007,But for a real gas we must use the average speed of all the particles.Video: 23VT
1008,In grade 10 you learnt how to calculate the molar concentration of a solution
1009,The molar concentration of a solution is the number of moles of solute per litre of solvent ()
1010,"This is more commonly given as moles of solute per cubic decimetre of solution ().To calculate concentration we use , where is the molar concentration, is the number of moles and is the volume of the solution.Calculating molar concentrations is useful to determine how much solute we need to add to a given volume of solvent in order to make a standard solution.A standard solution is a solution in which the concentration is known to a high degree of precision"
1011,"When we work with standard solutions we can take the concentration to be constant.When you are busy with these calculations, you will need to remember the following:===, therefore dividing a volume in by will give you the equivalent volume in"
1012,How much sodium chloride (in g) will one need to prepare of a standard solution with a concentration of
1013,The volume must be converted to : To find the mass of we need the molar mass of
1014,We can get this from the periodic table (recall from grade 10 how to calculate the molar mass of a compound).The mass of sodium chloride needed is We will now look at another use of concentration which is for titration calculations.TitrationsA titration is a technique for determining the concentration of an unknown solution
1015,Acid-base reactions and redox reactions are both commonly used for titrations.In grade 10 you did a simple acid-base titration
1016,Now we will look at how to calculate the concentration of an unknown solution using an acid-base titration.When performing a titration we say that the substance of unknown concentration is titrated with the standard solution
1017,A pipette is a measuring device that is used to measure an exact amount of a liquid
1018,If you use a pipette to add liquid to a flask then you would say that the liquid was pipetted into a flask.We can reduce the number of calculations that we have to do in titration calculations by using the following: The and are the stoichiometric coefficients of compounds A and B respectively
1019,It was found that of the sodium hydroxide was needed to neutralise the acid
1020,"Using an acid-base titration, it was found that of this solution was able to completely neutralise of a sodium hydroxide solution"
1021,"First convert the volume into :Then calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid:Now we can calculate the concentration of the sulfuric acid:Remember that only or of the sulfuric acid solution is used.Exercise 8.2See solutions Acetylene () burns in oxygen according to the following reaction: If of acetylene gas is burnt, what volume of carbon dioxide will be produced"
1022,We first work out what mass of magnesium chloride is needed to make a solution with a concentration of
1023,It was found that of the nitric acid was needed to neutralise the base
1024,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
1025,It was found that of the phosphoric acid was needed to neutralise the base
1026,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
1027,of this solution is then pipetted into a conical flask and titrated with hydrochloric acid
1028,It is found that of the hydrochloric acid completely neutralises the antacid solution
1029,Remember that only or of the calcium carbonate solution is used
1030,This chapter builds on the work covered in electrostatics in grade 10
1031,Learners should be familiar with the two types of charges and with simple calculations of amount of charge
1032,The following list summarises the topics covered in this chapter.Coulomb's law In this part of the topic learners are introduced to Coulomb's law
1033,This is an inverse square law and has a similar form to Newton's law of Universal Gravitation
1034,Electric fields The concept of an electric field is introduced in this part of the chapter
1035,Learners will see how to draw the electric field lines for different configurations of charges and will learn how to determine the magnitude of the electric field
1036,Learners will also learn how to calculate the electric field at a point due to a number of point charges
1037,"In this chapter you will learn exactly how to determine this force and about a basic law of electrostatics.Ratio and proportion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsScientific notation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skills"
1038,This chapter takes the ideas of magnetism and the ideas of electricity and combines them into one
1039,The following list summarises the topics covered in this chapter.Magnetic fields are associated with current carrying wires The idea that magnetism and electricity are linked is introduced
1040,The concept of a magnetic field around a current carrying wire is explored and a simple method to determine the direction of the magnetic field is explained
1041,Faraday's law Faraday's law relates the emf produced to the magnetic flux around a loop of conductor
1042,The concept of electromagnetic induction is introduced and some simple calculations using Faraday's law are shown
1043,"Electromagnetism describes the interaction between charges, currents and the electric and magnetic fields to which they give rise"
1044,An electric current creates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field will create a flow of charge
1045,"This has resulted in the invention of many devices which are useful to humans, for example cellular telephones, microwave ovens, radios, televisions and many more."
1046,The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in the real-world
1047,We depend on electricity and electrical appliances to make many things possible in our daily lives
1048,"This becomes very clear when there is a power failure and we can't use the kettle to boil water for tea or coffee, can't use the stove or oven to cook dinner, can't charge our cellphone batteries, watch TV, or use electric lights.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesGraphs - Mathematics, Grade 10, Functions and graphs"
1049,"When a chemical reaction occurs, bonds in the reactants break, while new bonds form in the product"
1050,"Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, according to the following equation:In this reaction, the bond between the two hydrogen atoms in the molecule will break, as will the bond between the oxygen atoms in the molecule"
1051,"New bonds will form between the two hydrogen atoms and the single oxygen atom in the water molecule that is formed as the product.For bonds to break, energy must be absorbed"
1052,The energy that is needed to break a bond is called the bond energy or bond dissociation energy
1053,Bond energies are measured in units of .Bond energy Bond energy is a measure of bond strength in a chemical bond
1054,It is the amount of energy (in ) that is needed to break the chemical bond between two atoms
1055,Remember when we discussed bonding (chapter 3) we used the following energy diagram:We can use this diagram to understand why bond breaking requires energy and bond making releases energy
1056,"When a bond breaks, the atoms move apart and the distance between them increases (i.e"
1057,the atom moves to the right on the -axis or from point X to point A)
1058,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy increases (i.e"
1059,the energy at point A is greater than the energy at point X)
1060,So when a bond breaks energy is needed.When a bond forms the atoms move closer together and the distance between them decreases (i.e
1061,the atom moves to the left on the -axis or from point A to point X)
1062,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy decreases (i.e"
1063,the energy at point X is less than the energy at point A)
1064,So when a bond forms energy is released.Looking at the example of hydrogen reacting with oxygen to form water:We see that energy is needed to break the bonds in the hydrogen molecule and to break the bonds in the oxygen molecule)
1065,And we also see that energy is released when hydrogen and oxygen bond to form water)
1066,"When we look at the entire reaction and consider both bond breaking and bond forming we need to look at the enthalpy of the system.Enthalpy Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a chemical system for a given pressure, and is given the symbol H"
1067,A chemical system is a closed system that contains only the reactants and products involved in the reaction.As we learn about exothermic and endothermic reactions we will see more on the concept of enthalpy.
1068,Up to now you have looked at reactions as starting with the reactants and going to the products
1069,For acids and bases we also need to consider what happens if we swop the reactants and the products around
1070,And that when (the base) gains a proton it forms (the acid)
1071,In your own words explain what is meant by the term conjugate acid-base pair
1072,A conjugate acid-base pair is a reactant and product pair that is transformed into each other through the loss or gain of a proton
1073,So for example an acid loses a proton to form a base
1074,The acid and the resulting base are said to be a conjugate acid-base pair
1075,This chapter looks at the lithosphere and explores mining in more detail
1076,"Mining is very important in South Africa as a large part of the economy depends on gold, diamond and coal mining"
1077,"This chapter looks at the history of mankind, what the lithosphere is, what is in the lithosphere and then goes on to look at mining"
1078,The general techniques used across all types of mining are looked at and then gold mining is explored in greater detail
1079,Learners can do the mining section as a project (either in groups or individually) that they then present to the class
1080,"If learners do a project ensure that each mineral listed in CAPs (iron, phosphate, coal, diamond, copper, platinum, zinc, chrome, asbestos, manganese and gold) is covered by at least one learner in the class.This topic provides a great opportunity to look at social justice and economic concerns"
1081,The various class discussions and debates provided give learners the chance to think about some critical issues in South Africa.In Grade 10 we studied the elements
1082,We learnt about the different elements and the compounds that could be formed from those elements
1083,Where did mankind find them and how has he used them?This chapter will explore the part of the Earth known as the lithosphere
1084,We will find out what the lithosphere is and how the elements are distributed within it.
1085,"In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion, in Grade 11 we learnt about forces and how they can alter the motion of an object"
1086,In this chapter we will focus on what happens when two bodies undergo a contact interaction and how their motion is affected
1087,"We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse.We can begin by considering some scenarios to set the context"
1088,Most people have some intuition for physics based on their everyday experiences but they haven't formalised it
1089,We can use our intuitive answers to lead into more structured thinking about physical events.Momentum transfer doesn't require a contact interaction but we won't consider any non-contact scenarios in this chapter.Everyone has experienced a mosquito landing on their arm and it can happen quite unnoticed
1090,Consider the case of a falcon landing on your arm (ignore the sharp claws for now)
1091,"Would you still notice if the mosquito flew the same way as a falcon, or if the falcon copied the flight of a mosquito before landing"
1092,"You probably would still notice, but try to think about what makes them so different.Look at a motorcycle, motorcar and truck"
1093,"Which of them is more likely to result in less damage in a collision situation, why"
1094,What factors would you change to reduce potential damage.Why is the Moon's orbit largely unaffected when it is hit by asteroid?The factors that come up in these considerations are how fast things are moving and how massive they are
1095,A falcon moving at the same speed as a mosquito still has a much larger mass
1096,"Even if a mosquito moved as fast as a falcon it wouldn't bother us because the mass of a mosquito is so small.If a motorcycle, motorcar and truck were all moving at the same speed then it would be much safer to be in a collision with the motorcycle but a truck doesn't have to be moving as fast as a motorcycle to have a huge impact in a collision because of its large mass.There is an interplay between mass and speed (velocity to be precise) that governs what would happen if these objects came into contact with another object"
1097,"There are two quantities that depend on mass and velocity, kinetic energy and momentum"
1098,Momentum is different to kinetic energy and is what we will focus on in the first part of this chapter
1099,"In the second part we will cover some of the differences between kinetic energy and momentum.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesThe following must be covered by the end of this chapter:Momentum:The definition of momentum.The calculations done on momentum using p = mv and the change in momentum under the influence of a resultant force.The understanding of the vector nature of momentum and the applications concerning momentum.Representing momentum using vector diagrams.Newton's second law expressed in terms of momentum:State Newton's second law in terms of momentum.Expression of Newton's second law in terms of symbols.Emphasis on the vector nature of momentumThe relationship between the net force and change in momentum for a variety of motions by using different examples.Do calculations on the change in momentum when a resultant force acts on an object to change the velocity.Conservation of momentum:Definition of :A systemInternal forcesExternal forcesIsolated systemState the law of conservation of momentum.Explain the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions by using the concept of kinetic energy before and after a collision.Do calculations on the principle of conservation of momentum.Do practical demonstrations on the principle of conservation of momentum.Applications of the principle of conservation of momentum.Impulse:Definition of impulse.The understanding of the vector nature of impulse.The change in momentum and impulse are equal to each other (impulse-momentum theorem).Calculations done by using the impulse-momentum theorem.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, Forces"
1100,"In this chapter we are going to look at the motion of objects that are either projected, thrown, or shot directly into the air, be it vertically upwards, downwards or when objects are dropped"
1101,"This is something that everyone has experienced while playing games and we all have a strong intuition that 'what goes up, must come down', but now we'll study why that is the case.Video: 27JYUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsRectilinear motion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Motion in one dimensionLinear equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesQuadratic equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, FunctionsUnderstand the principle of free falling under gravity with a constant acceleration for an upwards and downwards motion.Know that it's only vertical displacement no horizontal displacement.Always move only under the influence of only gravity.The meaning of time symmetry and the magnitude of velocity.Do an experiment to measure the position and time during a motion.Calculations done on projectiles by knowing how to use a single set of equations.Graphical representations of the equations of motion - Draw graphs for the projectiles motions.Deduct equations and determine the position, displacement, velocity or acceleration from the graphs.Describe the motion of the object from the graphs.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsRectilinear motion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Motion in one dimensionLinear equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesQuadratic equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Functions"
1102,"This section studies simple organic molecules, functional groups and the physical properties associated with these functional groups"
1103,"Only molecules with one type of functional group, and no more than three of the same functional group, should be studied"
1104,This section is a basis for any organic chemistry they may study beyond school so it is important that learners have a thorough understanding of this chapter
1105,"Some common polymers are also covered in this chapter, learners should understand the environmental impacts of these polymers as well as their connection with simple organic molecules through the monomers they are formed from.This section of work is the first chemistry chapter of the Grade 12 year"
1106,Learners should have an understanding of intermolecular forces and chemical bonds from Grade 11
1107,"If possible more time could be given here to ensure a thorough understanding, as there is a lot of work to cover.Emphasis should be placed on the different representations of organic compounds: macroscopic, sub-microscopic, symbolic representations and the links between all three"
1108,"Where possible, use atomic model kits to help explain reactions, physical properties and the structure of molecules.The following topics are covered in this chapter"
1109,"What makes a molecule organic, and organic molecular structures This chapter starts with a brief introduction to what makes a molecule organic (containing carbon atoms)"
1110,This then leads in to the properties of carbon that make it so unique
1111,"Learners are introduced to structural, semi-structural, condensed and molecular formula representations for molecules"
1112,It is important that they have a thorough understanding of this before moving on as they will use these representations throughout the chapter
1113,"It is also important that learners understand that molecules are not two-dimensional, if possible do some demonstrations with atomic model kits so they can get a better feel for the shape of an organic molecule"
1114,"Semi-structural representations are not required by CAPS, but will be shown in many textbooks and so it would be good for the student to understand them"
1115,Functional groups Understanding functional groups is essential to understanding organic molecules
1116,"An introduction to each of the required basic functional groups, the homologous series to which they belong, and their general formulas are covered in this section: hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes), alcohols, alkyl halides (specifically haloalkanes), aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters"
1117,"The concept of saturated and unsaturated compounds is also covered, this will become more important later in the chapter when studying reactions"
1118,"Isomers of compounds with the same functional groups, and compounds with different functional groups are also covered"
1119,IUPAC naming A good knowledge of IUPAC naming is very important in organic chemistry
1120,"This section walks the learners through the naming of the functional groups, with many worked examples"
1121,Going through those worked examples and the associated exercises will help the learners understand this section
1122,There are a number of in-class activities provided that will also help with understanding
1123,"The naming of compounds with more than three of the same functional group, or more than one functional group, is not required by CAPS"
1124,"Chain lengths of no more than eight carbon atoms are allowed, and esters may not have branched groups"
1125,Physical propeties and structure A revision of Grade 11 intermolecular forces would be useful before starting this section
1126,The important IMF this year are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces
1127,"The physical properties covered include: viscosity, density, melting and boiling points, flammability and vapour pressure, volatility, physical state, smell"
1128,It would be good for learners to revise molecular shape from Grade 11 as well
1129,"The changes in physical properties are linked to the intermolecular forces of the molecule, which is in turn linked to functional groups, chain length and chain branching"
1130,"Although these are seperated into sections the learner should understand that they are linked (different intermolecular forces are due to functional groups, chain length, etc.)"
1131,Applications of organic chemistry In this section learners will explore the applications of organic molecules
1132,"Specifically the cracking of hydrocarbons, and the (complete) combustion of alkanes"
1133,"Esters are also covered in more detail in this section, with industrial uses"
1134,"Addition, elimination and substitution reactions The learners need to know the addition, elimination and substitution reactions mentioned in this section, including reaction conditions and the major and minor products that will be formed"
1135,"They should understand the difference between an addition reaction, an elimination reaction and a substitution reaction and the reactants required in each specific reaction"
1136,"Plastics and polymers The polymers covered in this section are: polyethene, polypropene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid"
1137,"Learners should understand what makes a compound a polymer, the difference between an addition and a condensation reaction, and how to determine the polymer from the monomer and the monomer from the polymer"
1138,"The learners will be using dangerous chemicals and should be properly instructed on the correct use of safety equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and protective clothing"
1139,They should also be reminded not to sniff any chemicals as the fumes can be dangerous as well
1140,More information on laboratory procedures as well as safety precautions is provided in Chapter 1 (Science skills).These experiments are also an excellent opportunity to get the learners to research organic molecules
1141,Before any experiment the hazards of the chemicals being worked with should be studied
1142,Have the learners do the research for at least some of the experiments before completing them as a way of better understanding the molecules.Do not confuse organic compounds with naturally produced food
1143,Organic compounds are often produced in a laboratory.Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with organic molecules
1144,"An organic molecule is one which contains carbon, although not all compounds that contain carbon are organic molecules"
1145,"Noticeable exceptions are carbon monoxide (), carbon dioxide (), carbonates (eg calcium carbonate), carbides (eg calcium carbide) and cyanides (eg sodium cyanide)"
1146,Pure carbon compounds such as diamond and graphite are also not organic compounds
1147,"Organic molecules can range in size from simple molecules to complex structures containing thousands of atoms!Although carbon is present in all organic compounds, other elements such as hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur and phosphorus are also common in these molecules.Organic moleculeAn organic molecule is a molecule that contains carbon atoms (generally bonded to other carbon atoms as well as hydrogen atoms).Organic compounds are very important in daily life and they range from simple to extremely complex (Figure 4.1)"
1148,"Organic molecules make up a big part of our own bodies, they are in the food we eat and in the clothes we wear"
1149,"Organic compounds are also used to make products such as medicines, plastics, washing powders, dyes, along with a long list of other items"
1150,"There are millions organic compounds found in nature, as well as millions of synthetic (man-made) organic compounds."
1151,"We use the term `work' in everyday conversation to mean many different things.We talk about going to work, doing homework, working in class.Physicists mean something very specific when they talk about work.In Physics we use the term work to describe the process of transferring energy from object or system to another or converting energy from one form to another.You will learn that work and energy are closely related to Newton's laws of motion"
1152,You shall see that the energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another by means of a force
1153,"In other words, an object with lots of energy can do lots of work"
1154,"when object A transfers energy to object B, the energy of object A decreases by the same amount as the energy of object B increases, we say that object A does work on object B"
1155,Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them
1156,Even making an electrical current flow requires that something do work
1157,"Objects or systems must have energy to be able to do work on other objects or systems by transferring some of their energy.Units and unit conversions, Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesForce diagrams - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesVideo: 27RGWork:Define word done on an object by a force.Understand that work is a scalar.Calculations done on the net work done on an object.Understand the difference of positive, negative and no work done.Drawing of force diagrams to determine the net work done on an object - Ignore perpendicular forces.Work-energy theorem:Know the difference between conservative and non-conservative forces.Understand the result of a net force working in on an object.Application of the work-energy theorem to objects on horizontal and inclined planes.Calculations of different motions of objects.Conservation of energy:Definition of conservative and non-conservative forces and examples.Know the relationship between conservative and non-conservative forces and mechanical energy.Calculations done on the conservation of energy.Using calculations to prove the relationship between non-conservative forces and mechanical energy.Power:Definition of power as the rate at which work is done.Calculations done when work is done.Understand what is needed to keep an object moving at a constant speed.Calculations done when an object moves at a constant speed.Calculations done on power.Calculations done on maximum and minimum power.Units and unit conversions, Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesForce diagrams - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, Forces"
1158,"Have you noticed how the pitch of a police car or ambulance siren changes as it passes where you are standing, or how an approaching car or train sounds different to when it is tavelling away from you"
1159,"If you haven't, try to do an experiment by paying extra careful attention the next time it happens to see if you can notice a difference in pitch"
1160,"This doesn't apply to just vehicles and trains but anything that emits waves, be those sound waves or any other electromagnetic (EM) waves.The effect actually occurs if you move towards or away from the source of the sound as well"
1161,"This effect is known as the Doppler effect and will be studied in this chapter.The Doppler effect is named after Johann Christian Andreas Doppler (29 November 1803 - 17 March 1853), an Austrian mathematician and physicist who first explained the phenomenon in 1842.Video: 27SRUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations, Mathematics - Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesSound waves - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, SoundElectromagnetic radiation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Electromagnetic radiationThe Doppler Effect with sound:Definition of the Doppler Effect with examples.Explanation to what happens with sound when objects move relative to each other.Calculations done to determine the frequency when one of the two objects are moving.Description of applications with ultra sound waves.THE Doppler Effect with light:Understand the relationship between light and the Doppler Effect.Application of the Doppler Effect and light concerning the universe.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesSound waves - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, SoundElectromagnetic radiation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Electromagnetic radiation"
1162,"A car slowly rusting away, a match burning, a tablet dissolving in water"
1163,All of these are chemical reactions and all of these take place at different rates
1164,"If you were to hold a race between these three reactions you would find that the match wins (it burns quickly), while the car rusting would lose (it may take years to rust).In this chapter we will look at why reactions proceed at different rates (speeds) and how we can change the rate of the reaction.In physics, speed is the scalar measurement that tells us how fast or slow an object is moving (position vs"
1165,For reactions the speed (or rate) of a reaction means how fast or slow the reaction is and indicates the amount of product formed and the amount of reactants used per unit time.
1166,To define chemical equilibrium we need to ask some important questions about reactions: Does a reaction always run its full course so that all the reactants are used up
1167,When all the reactants in a reaction are used up the reaction is said to have gone to completion
1168,Does a reaction always proceed in the same direction or can it be reversed
1169,"In other words, does a reaction always proceed reactants products, or is it possible that a reaction will reverse and go products reactants"
1170,"However, in some reactions the reactants form products (in a ), and the products can change back into reactants (in a )"
1171,"Can a reaction reach a point where reactants are still present, but there does not seem to be any further change taking place in the reaction"
1172,"In all reactions, as the amount of reactant in a reaction decreases the product is formed more slowly"
1173,"In a reversible reaction, as the amount of product increases the reactant is formed more quickly"
1174,Eventually the rate of the forward reaction (reactants products) equals the rate of the reverse reaction (products reactants)
1175,At this point there but there does not appear to be any further change taking place
1176,Chemical equilibrium is the state of a reversible reaction where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1177,While a reaction is in equilibrium the concentration of the reactants and products are constant.Chemical equilibrium A reaction is in chemical equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1178,In the bottle there is carbon dioxide () dissolved in the liquid
1179,There is also gas in the space between the liquid and the cap
1180,"There is a constant movement of from the liquid to the gas phase, and from the gas phase into the liquid"
1181,"However, if you look at the bottle there does not appear to be any change"
1182,The system is in equilibrium.Without chemical equilibrium life as we know it would not be possible
1183,Another example of equilibrium in our everyday lives goes on within our very bodies
1184,"The haemoglobin has to be able to take up oxgen, but also to release it and this is done through changes in the chemical equilibrium of this reaction in different places in our bodies.haemoglobin(aq) + haemoglobin((aq)Haemoglobin, inside red blood cells in the lungs, bonds with oxygen"
1185,This oxyhaemoglobin moves with the red blood cells through the blood stream to cells throughout the body.This video is a good demonstration of how a reaction reaches equilibrium with time.Video: 27VFThe important thing for the students to understand in this experiment is that there is constant movement
1186,"Molecules at the surface of the water in the closed beaker are constantly evaporating, and gas molecules are constantly condensing"
1187,"There is no change in the level of the liquid and the total number molecules in the liquid and the gas state remain constant.Point out that the level of water in the sealed container also drops initially, before finally remaining constant"
1188,This concept will help learners understand how the rate of the forward reaction decreases until equilibrium is reached.Evaporation is when a substance goes from the liquid phase to the gas phase (it evaporates)
1189,Condensation is when a substance goes from the gas phase to the liquid phase (it condenses).The bottle contains water vapour (gas) and water droplets are condensing on the side of the bottle.An open system is one in which matter or energy can flow into or out of the system
1190,"In the liquid-gas demonstration we used, the first beaker was an example of an open system because the beaker could be heated or cooled (a change in energy), and water vapour (the matter) could evaporate from the beaker.Open system An open system is one whose borders allow the movement of energy and matter into and out of the system"
1191,"A closed system is one in which energy can enter or leave, but matter cannot"
1192,The second beaker with the glass cover is an example of a closed system
1193,"The beaker can still be heated or cooled, but water vapour cannot leave the system because the glass cover is a barrier"
1194,Condensation changes the vapour to liquid and returns it to the beaker
1195,"In other words, there is no loss of matter from the system.Generally, some of the molecules at the surface of liquids and solids are moving into the gas phase"
1196,"However, this is such a small fraction of the total volume of the liquid or solid that a reaction involving only solids or liquids can be considered a closed system.It is useful to simplify situations in science by dividing the world into the system we are studying, and the surrounding environment that might influence the reaction, but is not part of it.Closed system A closed system is one in which only energy can move into and out of the system"
1197,Matter cannot be gained by the system nor lost from the system
1198,"In a closed system it is possible for reactions to be reversible, such as in the demonstration above"
1199,"In a closed system, it is also possible for a chemical reaction to reach equilibrium.Some reactions can take place in two directions"
1200,"In the other direction, the products react to form the reactants again"
1201,A special double-headed arrow ( ) is used to show this type of :A reversible reaction A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions
1202,"In other words, the reactants and products of the reaction may reverse roles"
1203,Remember that implies that A goes to B and cannot become A again
1204,"A can go to B and B can go to A.So, in the following reversible reaction: is the reaction.The forward reaction is always taken from the given equation and written: left to right"
1205,is the reaction.The reverse reaction is always taken from the given equation and written: right to left.Exercise 8.1See solutionsWhich of the following situations describes a closed system
1206,The water vapour can leave the pot (system) if there is no lid
1207,Assume that none of the solid or liquid reactants or products go into the gas phase
1208,"Initially (time = ), the rate of the is high (fast)"
1209,As the reaction gets closer to equilibrium the rate of decrease levels out until the forward reaction has a constant rate.Initially the rate of the is low (slow)
1210,"As the reaction progresses the rate of increase levels out until the reverse reaction has a constant rate.At this point the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal and this is called .Although it is not always possible to observe any macroscopic changes, this does not mean that the reaction has stopped"
1211,The forward and reverse reactions continue to take place and so microscopic changes still occur in the system
1212,This state is called dynamic equilibrium.Dynamic equilibrium There is a dynamic equilibrium in a reversible reaction when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1213,"In the liquid-gas phase equilibrium demonstration, dynamic equilibrium was reached when there was no observable change in the level of the water in the second beaker even though evaporation and condensation continued to take place.For more information on dynamic equilibriums watch this video:Video: 27VJ"
1214,A different concept to strong and weak is the concept of concentrated and dilute
1215,Thus a strong acid can be prepared as either a concentrated or a dilute solution
1216,A solution of which the exact concentration is known is called a standard solution
1217,A concentrated solution is one where a large amount of a substance (solute) has been added to a solvent
1218,Note that both strong and weak acids and bases can be used in concentrated solutions
1219,Concentrated solution A concentrated solution is one where there is a high ratio of dissolved substance (eg acid or base) to solvent
1220,A dilute solution is one where a small amount of a substance has been added to a solvent
1221,Note that both strong and weak acids and bases can be used in dilute solutions
1222,A concentrated solution has a lot of solute molecules (red circles) in the solvent
1223,A dilute solution has few solute molecules (red circles) in the solvent
1224,Dilute solution A dilute solution is one where there is a low ratio of dissolved substance to solvent
1225,A concentrated solution can be made from a strong or a weak acid or base
1226,A dilute solution can also be made from a strong or a weak acid or base
1227,Whether a solution is concentrated or dilute depends on how much of the acid or base was added to the solvent
1228,"A strong base that is also concentrated would be a base that almost completely dissociates when added to a solution, and you also add a large amount of the base to the solution"
1229,"A weak acid that is also dilute would be an acid where only a small percentage of molecules ionise when added to a solution, and you also add only a small amount of the acid to the solution"
1230,The electrical conductivity of a solution depends on the concentration of mobile ions in the solution
1231,"This means that a concentrated solution of a strong acid or base will have a high electrical conductivity, while a dilute solution of a weak acid or base will have a low electrical conductivity"
1232,"Therefore, the more ions (charged particles) there are in a solution, the greater the electric current that can be conducted through the solution by the charged particles"
1233,These include ions in solution and ions in melted ionic materials
1234,Only a small percentage of the molecules dissociate in the solution
1235,Almost complete ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is strong
1236,Only a small amount of ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is weak
1237,"Almost all the molecules ionise in the solution, therefore is a strong acid"
1238,"Only a small percentage of the molecules dissociate, therefore is a weak base"
1239,A concentrated solution has a high ratio of solute to solvent
1240,A dilute solution has a low ratio of solute to solvent
1241,"This is a high ratio, therefore the solution of is concentrated"
1242,"This is a low ratio, therefore the solution of is dilute"
1243,Only a small percentage of the molecules ionise in the solution
1244,Almost complete ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is strong
1245,Only a small amount of ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is weak
1246,"Almost all the molecules dissociate in the solution, therefore is a strong base"
1247,"Only a small percentage of the molecules ionise, therefore is a weak acid"
1248,A concentrated solution has a high ratio of solute to solvent
1249,A dilute solution has a low ratio of solute to solvent
1250,"This is a low ratio, therefore the solution of is dilute"
1251,"This is a high ratio, therefore the solution of is concentrated"
1252,To do that the molar mass (M) needs to be calculated
1253,M() = ( x ) + + ( x ) =
1254,To do that the molar mass (M) needs to be calculated
1255,For every mole of a solvent there are moles of lithium hydroxide ()
1256,There are many more moles of the base than the solvent
1257,For every moles of a solvent there are moles of nitric acid ()
1258,There are many more moles of the solvent than the acid
1259,% of an unknown acid donates protons when the acid is added to water
1260,This means that it almost completely forms ions in solution and is therefore a strong acid
1261,Is a solution with a pH of strongly or weakly acidic
1262,Although this is a strong acid the solution is only weakly acidic
1263,This means that there must be a very small number of moles of the acid in the total volume of the solution
1264,You need the number of moles (n) and the molar mass (M)
1265,You need the number of moles (n) and the molar mass (M)
1266,"You have the volume (V) and original concentration of the ammonia solution, you need number of moles (n) in that original solution"
1267,Therefore n = C x V n(original solution of ) = x =
1268,The final volume used to calculate the concentration must be the volume of the water plus the volume of ammonia added
1269,The study of electrical circuits is essential to understanding the technology that uses electricity in the real-world

1271,In Grade 11 you learnt how a magnetic field is generated around a current-carrying conductor
1272,You also learnt how a current is generated in a conductor that moves in a magnetic field or in a stationay conductor in a changing magnetic field
1273,"This chapter describes how conductors moving in a magnetic field are applied in the real-world.Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society"
1274,"The ubiquitous generator—found in automobiles, on bicycles, in nuclear power plants, and so on—uses magnetism to generate current"
1275,"Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances"

1277,Many people are using solar power as a source of energy for their homes
1278,Solar power can be used to heat water or to supply electricity

1281,An easy way to remember this is:In both oxidation and reduction a transfer of electrons is involved resulting in a change in the oxidation state of the elements
1282,"In each of the following reactions say whether the reactant iron species (, , ) is oxidised or reduced"
1283,"This section studies the use of resources, more specifically phosphate rock, natural gas and other gases (like nitrogen and oxygen) to produce fertilisers to sustain a food supply for people on Earth"
1284,The industrial processes that are involved in the manufacturing of fertilisers are studied
1285,"The purpose of studying this industry is to make learners aware of the impact of human activities on the environment and our responsibility to use our resources sustainably.Prior knowledgeThis section of work is done at the end of the Grade 12 year and provides an ideal opportunity to revise some of the concepts covered in redox reactions, rates and extent of reactions, acid-base reactions and balancing of equations"
1286,The prior knowledge for this chapter includes a general awareness that the chemistry that is done at school has application in industrial processes in South Africa and elsewhere
1287,"Two examples that would have been covered in the electrochemistry section, namely the production of chlorine and the recovery of aluminium metal from bauxite, can provide a useful context to study further application of chemistry in real life"
1288,"Furthermore, this section also builds on learners’ prior knowledge of the lithosphere and how we are using these resources on Earth.PlanningCAPS allocates 6 hours for this section"
1289,"The suggested lessons can be adapted, depending on the length of the lessons at your school and how much time you have to teach the section"
1290,Introduction to the importance of nutrients This section covers the importance of nutrients and is necessary to understand the role of fertilisers
1291,In this lesson learners should do the concept map activity as a way of summarising the information
1292,"Learners should start on the investigation of fertiliser use in their area from this first lesson, as it is a long investigation and requires a community survey"
1293,The role of fertilisers In this lesson the role of fertilisers should be covered
1294,This includes an understanding of the NPK ratios and the specific nutrients found in different fertilisers
1295,The industrial preparation of fertilisers This section covers the industrial production of chemicals used in inorganic fertilisers
1296,At the end of the section there is a worksheet for the learners to complete
1297,"The worksheet, as well as the answer sheet is provided in this book"
1298,"This is a long section and, if time allows, should be covered over three lessons"
1299,Alternative sources of fertilisers In this lesson learners should understand and be able to name alternative sources of fertilisers
1300,At the end of the lesson they should complete the activity on alternative sources
1301,The investigation on fertiliser use in their area should be looked at
1302,They should have designed their survey and be collecting their data
1303,Fertilisers and the environment Eutrophication is one of the serious effects fertilisers can have on the environment
1304,"After going through this section the learners should go through the activity on dealing with the consequences of eutrophication, discussing how best to deal with this problem"
1305,The learners now have enough information to understand the data collected from their community
1306,They should be working on presenting their data on the use of fertiliser in their area and should be able to interpret their findings
1307,Learners work on their investigation in class The learners should work on their investigation on the use of fertilisers in their area in class
1308,This is also a good lesson for consolidation of the entire chapter by going through the end of chapter exercises in preparation for the exams
1309,"South Africa has a population of over 50 million people, and this number is increasing every year"
1310,"Therefore, maintaining healthy crops plays an important role in providing enough food for the nation"
1311,Fertilisers are used to provide sufficient nutrients to the soil in order to sustain optimum crop yields
1312,The fertiliser industry is therefore an important chemical industry in South Africa
1313,"In this chapter we will investigate what fertilisers are, why they are important, how they are produced and what their impact on the environment is."
1314,"All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of matter"
1315,"Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us"
1316,Even our own human bodies are made of matter!Different objects can be made of different types of materials (the matter from which objects are made)
1317,"For example, a cupboard (an object) is made of wood, nails, hinges and knobs (the materials)"
1318,The properties of the materials will affect the properties of the object
1319,"In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable"
1320,"Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes (eg clay, dough)"
1321,Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires (eg copper)
1322,The boiling and melting points of substances tells us the temperature at which the substance will boil or melt
1323,"This helps us to classify substances as solids, liquids or gases at a specific temperature"
1324,The diagram below shows one way in which matter can be classified (grouped) according to its different properties
1325,"As you read further in this chapter, you will see that there are also other ways of classifying materials, for example according to whether or not they are good electrical conductors."
1326,In this chapter we will explore the states of matter and then look at the kinetic molecular theory
1327,We will also examine how the kinetic theory of matter helps explain boiling and melting points as well as other properties of matter
1328,Diffusion can be seen as a spreading out of particles resulting in an even distribution of the particles
1329,You can see diffusion when you place a drop of food colouring in water
1330,"If matter were not made of particles that are constantly moving then we would only see a clump of colour when we put the food colouring in water, as there would be nothing that could move about and mix in with the water"
1331,"In 1828 Robert Brown observed that pollen grains suspended in water moved about in a rapid, irregular motion"
1332,Brownian motion can also be seen as the random to and fro movement of particles
1333,"Matter exists in one of three states, namely solid, liquid and gas"
1334,A liquid takes on the shape of the container that it is in
1335,Matter can change between these states by either adding heat or removing heat
1336,As we heat an object (eg water) it goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas
1337,Evaporation from a liquid's surface can happen at a wide range of temperatures
1338,If more energy is added then bubbles of gas appear inside the liquid and this is known as boiling
1339,Sublimation is the process of going from a solid to a gas
1340,Deposition is the process of going from a gas to a solid
1341,"If we know the melting and boiling point of a substance then we can say what state (solid, liquid or gas) it will be in at any temperature"
1342,A heating curve of a substance gives the changes in temperature as we move from a solid to a liquid to a gas
1343,A cooling curve gives the changes in temperature as we move from gas to liquid to solid
1344,"An important observation is that as a substance melts or boils, the temperature remains constant until the substance has changed state"
1345,This is because all the heat energy goes into breaking or forming the bonds between the molecules
1346,The following diagrams give examples of what heating and cooling curves look like:
1347,We have now looked at many examples of the types of matter and materials that exist around us and we have investigated some of the ways that materials are classified
1348,"In order to understand this, we need to take a closer look at the building blocks of matter — the atom"
1349,Atoms are the basis of all the structures and organisms in the universe
1350,"The planets, sun, grass, trees, air we breathe and people are all made up of different combinations of atoms.Video: VPrkk"
1351,The periodic table of the elements is a method of showing the chemical elements in a table with the elements arranged in order of increasing atomic number
1352,Most of the work that was done to arrive at the periodic table that we know can be attributed to a Russian chemist named Dmitri Mendeleev
1353,Mendeleev designed the table in 1869 in such a way that recurring (periodic) trends or patterns in the properties of the elements could be shown
1354,"Using the trends he observed, he left gaps for those elements that he thought were “missing”"
1355,He also predicted the properties that he thought the missing elements would have when they were discovered
1356,Many of these elements were indeed discovered and Mendeleev's predictions were proved to be correct
1357,"To show the recurring properties that he had observed, Mendeleev began new rows in his table so that elements with similar properties were in the same vertical columns, called groups"
1358,The full periodic table is reproduced at the front of this book
1359,"These are the energies needed to remove the second, third, or fourth electron respectively"
1360,"If you look at a periodic table, you will see the groups numbered at the top of each column"
1361,The groups are numbered from left to right starting with 1 and ending with 18
1362,This is the convention that we will use in this book
1363,"On some periodic tables you may see that the groups are numbered from left to right as follows: 1, 2, then an open space which contains the transition elements, followed by groups 3 to 8"
1364,A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table of the elements
1365,"The periods are labelled from top to bottom, starting with 1 and ending with 7"
1366,For each element on the periodic table we can give its period number and its group number
1367,We can also determine the electronic structure of an element from its position on the periodic table
1368,In Chapter 4 you worked out the electronic configuration of various elements
1369,Using the periodic table we can easily give the electronic configurations of any element
1370,"For example, phosphorus () is in the third period and group 15"
1371,"Looking at the figure above, we see that the p-orbital is being filled"
1372,Similar trends are observed in the other periods of the periodic table
1373,The chlorides are compounds with chlorine and the oxides are compounds with oxygen
1374,"no oxides, but fluorine does combine with oxygen in compounds called oxygen fluorides"
1375,Draw a line graph to show the relationship between atomic number (on the x-axis) and ionisation energy (y-axis)
1376,A chemical bond is formed when atoms are held together by attractive forces
1377,"This attraction occurs when electrons are shared between atoms, or when electrons are exchanged between the atoms that are involved in the bond"
1378,"The sharing or exchange of electrons takes place so that the outer energy levels of the atoms involved are filled, making the atoms are more stable"
1379,"If an electron is shared, it means that it will spend its time moving in the electron orbitals around both atoms"
1380,If an electron is exchanged it means that it is transferred from one atom to another
1381,In other words one atom gains an electron while the other loses an electron.Chemical bond A chemical bond is the physical process that causes atoms and molecules to be attracted to each other and held together in more stable chemical compounds
1382,The type of bond that is formed depends on the elements that are involved
1383,"In this chapter, we will be looking at three types of chemical bonding: covalent, ionic and metallic bonding.You need to remember that it is the valence electrons (those in the outermost level) that are involved in bonding and that atoms will try to fill their outer energy levels so that they are more stable"
1384,"The noble gases have completely full outer energy levels, so are very stable and do not react easily with other atoms."
1385,A medium is the substance or material through which a pulse moves
1386,The medium does not create the pulse and the medium is not the pulse
1387,"Therefore the medium does not travel with the pulse as the pulse moves through it.In each medium, the particles that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest position"
1388,"In order for a pulse to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other.Medium A medium is the substance or material in which a pulse will move"
1389,"The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket"
1390,"All waves have the same properties.Waves do not only occur in water, they occur in any kind of medium"
1391,Earthquakes release enough energy to create waves that are powerful enough to travel through the rock of the Earth
1392,When your friend speaks to you sound waves are produced that travel through the air to your ears
1393,A wave is simply the disturbance of a medium by moving energy but how is it different from a pulse?
1394,Longitudinal waves A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
1395,When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave itself
1396,We will do the same for longitudinal waves.The question is how do we construct such a wave?A longitudinal wave is seen best in a slinky spring
1397,Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves parallel to the direction in which the spring was pulled
1398,The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium
1399,"The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave.Video: VPdkfAs in the case of transverse waves the following properties can be defined for longitudinal waves:wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed."
1400,A tuning fork is an instrument used by musicians to create sound waves of a specific frequency
1401,They are often used to tune musical instruments.Sound waves coming from a tuning fork are caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork which push against the air particles in front of it
1402,As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed
1403,The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction
1404,"As the particles continue to push against each other, the sound wave travels through the air"
1405,"Due to this motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air"
1406,"This means that in media where the particles are closer together, sound waves will travel faster.Tuning forkSound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together)"
1407,Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids.A sound wave is a pressure wave
1408,This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates
1409,These compressions and rarefactions arise because the source vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.
1410,The most common example of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is visible light
1411,"Everyone is very familiar with light in everyday life, you can only see things because light bounces off them and enters your eyes"
1412,This alone makes it worthwhile to learn about it but there are also very many other applications of EM radiation
1413,It is called electromagnetic because there are electric and magnetic fields making up the radiation
1414,"We will look at this in more detail a little later.In everyday experience, light doesn't seem to have many special properties but it does: A huge spectrum: The light we can see (visible EM radiation) is only a small part of all of the EM radiation (electromagnetic spectrum) that exists"
1415,Nature's speed limit: Nothing moves faster than the speed of light
1416,Wave nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a wave which we call wave-like behaviour
1417,Particle nature: All EM radiation has the ability to behave like a particle which we call particle-like behaviour
1418,No medium required: EM radiation can propagate without a medium through which to move even though they are waves
1419,We will discuss this in the following sections and in even more detail in Grades 11 and 12.
1420,Diagrams of compounds are very useful because they help us to picture how the atoms are arranged in the compound and they help us to see the shape of the compound
1421,"There are three types of diagrams that are commonly used: Wireframe or stick models In this model, the bonds between atoms are shown as “sticks”"
1422,Ball and stick models This is a 3-dimensional molecular model that uses “balls” to represent atoms and “sticks” to represent the bonds between them
1423,The centres of the atoms (the balls) are connected by straight lines which represent the bonds between them
1424,Table 12.1 shows examples of the different types of models for all the types of compounds.Covalent molecularCovalent networkIonic networkMetallic networkName of compoundglucosegraphitesilver chloridezincFormula or Stick modelBall-and-stick modelSpace-filling model Table 12.1: Different representations for compounds CanvasMol (www.alteredqualia.com/canvasmol) is a website that allows you to view several compounds
1425,"You do not need to know these compounds, this is simply to allow you to see one way of representing compounds."
1426,The synthesis (forming) of water () from hydrogen gas () and oxygen gas () is another example of chemical change
1427,A simplified diagram of this reaction is shown in Figure 13.3
1428,The chemical bonds between in and between in are broken and new bonds between and (to form ) are formed
1429,"A chemical change has taken place.Video: VPbhyA mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas is used as a fuel to get rockets into space.There are some important things to remember about chemical changes: Arrangement of particles During a chemical change, the particles themselves are changed in some way"
1430,"In the example of hydrogen peroxide that was used earlier, the molecules were split up into their component atoms"
1431,The number of particles will change because each molecule breaks down into two water molecules () and one oxygen molecule ()
1432,Energy changes The energy changes that take place during a chemical reaction are much greater than those that take place during a physical change in matter
1433,"During a chemical reaction, energy is used up in order to break bonds and then energy is released when the new product is formed"
1434,Reversibility Chemical changes are far more difficult to reverse than physical changes
1435,"When hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen, it is almost impossible to get back to hydrogen peroxide"
1436,"Mass conservation Mass is conserved during a chemical change, but the number of molecules may change"
1437,"In the example of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for every two molecules of hydrogen peroxide that decomposes, three molecules are formed (two water and one oxygen)"
1438,"Table 13.1 highlights these concepts for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.Moleculestwo moleculesthree moleculesEnergy changesenergy taken in when bonds are brokenenergy given off when bonds are formedMass is conservedAtoms are conserved oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms Table 13.1: Important concepts in chemical change Exercise 13.1See solutions For each of the following say whether a chemical or a physical change occurs"
1439,Melting candle wax.Mixing sodium chloride () and silver nitrate () to form silver chloride ().Mixing hydrochloric acid () and magnesium ribbon () to form magnesium chloride ().Dissolving salt in water.Tearing a piece of magnesium ribbon
1440,"As we have already mentioned, a number of changes can occur when elements are combined with one another"
1441,One way of representing chemical changes is through balanced chemical equations
1442,A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction by using symbols for the elements involved
1443,"For example, if we look at the reaction between iron and sulfur to form iron sulfide , we could represent these changes in a sentence, in a word equation or using chemical symbols: Sentence: Iron reacts with sulfur to form iron sulfide"
1444,A chemical formula shows each element by its symbol and also shows how many atoms of each element are found in that compound
1445,The number of atoms (if greater than one) is shown as a subscript.The following exercise serves as revision
1446,"Magnetism is an interaction that allows certain kinds of objects, which are called 'magnetic' objects, to exert forces on each other without physically touching"
1447,A magnetic object is surrounded by a magnetic 'field' that gets weaker as one moves further away from the object
1448,A second object can feel a magnetic force from the first object because it feels the magnetic field of the first object
1449,The further away the objects are the weaker the magnetic force will be.Video: VPfkkHumans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years
1450,"For example, lodestone is a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite"
1451,"It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around BCE in Europe and around BCE in Asia.Magnetic objects stuck to a magnetThe root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone."
1452,Electrostatics is the study of electric charge which is at rest or static (not moving)
1453,In this chapter we will look at some of the basic principles of electrostatics as well as the principle of conservation of charge.Video: VPfmg
1454,When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is not in a complete circuit you are measuring the emf of the battery
1455,"This is the maximum amount of work per coulomb of charge the battery can do to drive charge from one terminal, through the circuit, to the other terminal.The volt is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827).Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery that is in a complete circuit you are measuring the terminal potential difference of the battery"
1456,Although this is measured in volts it is not identical to the emf
1457,The difference will be the work done to drive charge through the battery.BatteriesOne lead of the voltmeter is connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end
1458,The voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of a circuit but must be connected in parallel.
1459,Many reactions in chemistry and all biological reactions (reactions in living systems) take place in water
1460,In this chapter we will look at some of these reactions in detail
1461,Almost all the reactions that occur in aqueous solutions involve ions
1462,"We will look at three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, namely precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions"
1463,"Before we can learn about the types of reactions, we need to first look at ions in aqueous solutions and electrical conductivity.Video: VPbls"
1464,"Sometimes it is important to know exactly how many particles (eg atoms or molecules) are in a sample of a substance, or what quantity of a substance is needed for a chemical reaction to take place.The amount of substance is so important in chemistry that it is given its own name, which is the mole.Mole The mole (abbreviation “mol”) is the SI (Standard International) unit for “amount of substance”"
1465,The mole is a counting unit just like hours or days
1466,We can easily count one second or one minute or one hour
1467,"If we want bigger units of time, we refer to days, months and years"
1468,"We call this number Avogadro's number.Avogadro's number The number of particles in a mole, equal to"
1469,"If we had this number of cold drink cans, then we could cover the surface of the earth to a depth of over"
1470,"If you could count atoms at a rate of 10 million per second, then it would take you 2 billion years to count the atoms in one mole!The original hypothesis that was proposed by Amadeo Avogadro was that “equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules”"
1471,"His ideas were not accepted by the scientific community and it was only four years after his death, that his original hypothesis was accepted and that it became known as “Avogadro's Law”"
1472,"In honour of his contribution to science, the number of particles in one mole was named Avogadro's number.We use Avogadro's number and the mole in chemistry to help us quantify what happens in chemical reaction"
1473,If we measure of carbon we have one mole or carbon atoms
1474,"You will remember that when the mass, in grams, of an element is equal to its relative atomic mass, the sample contains one mole of that element"
1475,This mass is called the molar mass of that element.You may sometimes see the molar mass written as
1476,"We will use in this book, but you should be aware of the alternate notation.It is worth remembering the following: On the periodic table, the relative atomic mass that is shown can be interpreted in two ways"
1477,"The mass (in grams) of a single, average atom of that element relative to the mass of an atom of carbon"
1478,The average atomic mass of all the isotopes of that element
1479,"ElementRelative atomic mass (u)Molar mass ()Mass of one mole of the element (g)MagnesiumLithiumOxygenNitrogenIron Table 19.1: The relationship between relative atomic mass, molar mass and the mass of one mole for a number of elements"
1480,Calculate the number of moles of iron (Fe) in an sample
1481,"If we look at the periodic table, we see that the molar mass of iron is"
1482,"This means that 1 mole of iron will have a mass of .If 1 mole of iron has a mass of , then: the number of moles of iron in must be:There are 2 moles of iron in the sample"
1483,You need to imagine that the horizontal line is like a division sign and that the vertical line is like a multiplication sign
1484,"So, for example, if you want to calculate , then the remaining two letters in the triangle are and and is above with a division sign between them"
1485,"Your calculation will then be Remember that when you use the equation , the mass is always in grams (g) and molar mass is in grams per mol ()"
1486,Always write the units next to any number you use in a formula or sum
1487,Calculate the number of moles of copper there are in a sample that with a mass of
1488,Calculate the number of atoms there are in a sample of aluminium that with a mass of
1489,"However, you need to remember that all your calculations will apply to the whole compound"
1490,"So, when you calculate the molar mass of a covalent compound, you will need to add the molar mass of each atom in that compound"
1491,The number of moles will also apply to the whole molecule
1492,"For example, if you have one mole of nitric acid () the molar mass is and there are molecules of nitric acid"
1493,This is the mass of all the atoms in one formula unit of the compound
1494,"For example, one mole of sodium chloride () has a formula mass of and there are molecules of sodium chloride in one formula unit.In a balanced chemical equation, the number that is written in front of the element or compound, shows the mole ratio in which the reactants combine to form a product"
1495,"If there are no numbers in front of the element symbol, this means the number is '1'.Video: VPezceg In this reaction, 1 mole of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen molecules to produce 2 moles of ammonia molecules"
1496,Scalars are physical quantities which have only a number value or a size (magnitude)
1497,A scalar tells you how much of something there is.Scalar A scalar is a physical quantity that has only a magnitude (size)
1498,"For example, a person buys a tub of margarine which is labelled with a mass of"
1499,The mass of the tub of margarine is a scalar quantity
1500,"It only needs one number to describe it, in this case, .Vectors are different because they are physical quantities which have a size and a direction"
1501,A vector tells you how much of something there is and which direction it is in.Vector A vector is a physical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction
1502,"For example, a car is travelling east along a freeway at"
1503,The car is moving at (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going – east (this is the direction)
1504,Your weight is proportional to your mass (magnitude) and is always in the direction towards the centre of the earth
1505,"This chapter is about how things move along a straight line or, more scientifically, how things move in one dimension"
1506,This is useful for learning how to describe the movement (motion) of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks
1507,There are three features of motion that we use to describe exactly how an object moves
1508,They are:The jerk is the name we give to how fast the acceleration is changing.Traffic often moves along a straight line
1509,"The word energy comes from the Greek word energeia (ένέργεια), meaning activity or operation"
1510,Energy is closely linked to mass and cannot be created or destroyed
1511,In this chapter we will consider gravitational potential and kinetic energy.Video: VPgjm
1512,"As far as we know, the Earth we live on is the only planet that is able to support life"
1513,"Amongst other factors, the Earth is just the right distance from the sun to have temperatures that are suitable for life to exist"
1514,"Also, the Earth's atmosphere has exactly the right type of gases in the right amounts for life to survive"
1515,"Our planet also has water on its surface, which is something very unique"
1516,"In fact, Earth is often called the “Blue Planet” because most of it is covered in water"
1517,"This water is made up of freshwater in rivers and lakes, the saltwater of the oceans and estuaries, groundwater and water vapour"
1518,"Together, all these water bodies are called the hydrosphere.The EarthVideo: VPbzp"
1519,In this chapter learners will explore Newtons three laws of motion and Newtons law of universal gravitation
1520,Learners will also learn more about forces and the different kinds of forces
1521,The following provides a summary of the topics covered in this chapter.Different kinds of forces
1522,"The types of forces covered are: normal force, frictional force, applied force and tension.Force diagrams and free body diagrams"
1523,In this section learners will see how to take a problem and draw diagrams to show all the forces acting on a body
1524,They will learn what a force diagram is and what a free body diagram is
1525,"Each law is covered in detail and practical applications such as rockets, lifts and seat belts are covered"
1526,Learners are introduced to the ideas of weight and mass as well as the acceleration due to gravity
1527,In this chapter we will learn how a net force is needed to modify the motion of an object
1528,We will recall what a force is and learn about how force and motion are related
1529,"We are also introduced to Newton's three laws and we will learn more about the force of gravity.Ratio and proportion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skills"
1530,Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons to form a chemical bond
1531,The outermost orbitals of the atoms overlap so that unpaired electrons in each of the bonding atoms can be shared
1532,"By overlapping orbitals, the outer energy shells of all the bonding atoms are filled"
1533,"As they move, there is an attraction between these negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei"
1534,This attractive force holds the atoms together in a covalent bond
1535,Covalent bond A form of chemical bond where pairs of electrons are shared between atoms
1536,We will look at a few simple cases to deduce some rules about covalent bonds
1537,"Remember that it is only the valence electrons that are involved in bonding, and so when diagrams are drawn to show what is happening during bonding, it is only these electrons that are shown"
1538,For this case we will look at hydrogen chloride and methane
1539,The electron configuration of hydrogen is and the electron configuration for chlorine is .The hydrogen atom has valence electron and the chlorine atom has valence electrons
1540,The Lewis diagrams for hydrogen and chlorine are: Notice the single unpaired electron (highlighted in blue) on each atom
1541,"This does not mean this electron is different, we use highlighting here to help you see the unpaired electron"
1542,Notice how the two unpaired electrons (one from each atom) form the covalent bond
1543,"The dot and cross in between the two atoms, represent the pair of electrons that are shared in the covalent bond"
1544,We can also show this bond using a single line: Note how we still show the other electron pairs around chlorine
1545,From this we can conclude that any electron on its own will try to pair up with another electron
1546,So in practise atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
1547,"Remember that we said we can place unpaired electrons at any position (top, bottom, left, right) around the elements symbol"
1548,Water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms
1549,From what we learnt in the first examples we see that the unpaired electrons can pair up
1550,"Instead of writing the Lewis diagram for hydrogen twice, we simply write it once and use the in front of it to indicate that two hydrogens are needed for each oxygen"
1551,And now we can answer the questions that we asked before the worked example
1552,"We see that oxygen forms two bonds, one with each hydrogen atom"
1553,Oxygen however keeps its electron pairs and does not share them
1554,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that electron pair
1555,A lone pair stays on the atom that it belongs to
1556,A lone pair can be used to form a dative covalent bond
1557,In the example above the lone pairs on oxygen are highlighted in red
1558,When we draw the bonding pairs using lines it is much easier to see the lone pairs on oxygen
1559,Notice the two electron pairs between the two oxygen atoms (highlighted in blue)
1560,"Because these two covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a double bond"
1561,This forms a double covalent bond (which is shown by a double line between the two oxygen atoms)
1562,"Hydrogen has valence electron, carbon has valence electrons and nitrogen has valence electrons"
1563,Notice the three electron pairs (highlighted in red) between the nitrogen and carbon atom
1564,"Because these three covalent bonds are between the same two atoms, this is a triple bond"
1565,Nitrogen keeps its electron pair and shares its three unpaired electrons with carbon
1566,A dative covalent bond is also known as a coordinate covalent bond
1567,Earlier we said that atoms with a pair of electrons will normally not share that pair to form a bond
1568,But now we will see how an electron pair can be used by atoms to form a covalent bond
1569,One example of a molecule that contains a dative covalent bond is the ammonium ion () shown in the figure below
1570,"The hydrogen ion does not contain any electrons, and therefore the electrons that are in the bond that forms between this ion and the nitrogen atom, come only from the nitrogen"
1571,Notice that the hydrogen ion is charged and that this charge is shown on the ammonium ion using square brackets and a plus sign outside the square brackets
1572,We can also show this as: Note that we do not use a line for the dative covalent bond
1573,So in theory atoms that have at least one unpaired electron can form bonds with any other atom that also has an unpaired electron
1574,If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that pair to form a bond
1575,If an atom has more than one unpaired electron it can form multiple bonds to another atom
1576,A dative covalent bond can be formed between an atom with no electrons and an atom with a lone pair
1577,There are dots around element Y and from our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we know that these represent the valence electrons
1578,X contributes one electron (represented by a cross) to the bond and X has no other electrons
1579,From our knowledge of Lewis diagrams we look at how many cross and dot pairs there are in the molecule and that gives us the number of covalent bonds
1580,These are single bonds since there is only one dot and cross pair between adjacent atoms
1581,Note that Y could also be sulfur and X hydrogen and the molecule would then be hydrogen sulfide (sulfur dihydride)
1582,"The types of intermolecular forces that occur in a substance will affect its properties, such as its phase, melting point and boiling point"
1583,"You should remember from the kinetic theory of matter (see grade ), that the phase of a substance is determined by how strong the forces are between its particles"
1584,"The weaker the forces, the more likely the substance is to exist as a gas"
1585,This is because the particles are able to move far apart since they are not held together very strongly
1586,"If the forces are very strong, the particles are held closely together in a solid structure"
1587,Remember also that the temperature of a material affects the energy of its particles
1588,"The more energy the particles have, the more likely they are to be able to overcome the forces that are holding them together"
1589,Note that we are showing two dimensional figures when in reality these are three dimensional
1590,"The following five experiments investigate the effect of various physical properties (evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling point and capillarity) of substances and determine how these properties relate to intermolecular forces"
1591,A formal experiment on the effects of intermolecular forces is included in this chapter
1592,"In this experiment learners will investigate how intermolecular forces affect evaporation, surface tension, solubility, boiling points and capillarity"
1593,"Some of the substances that are used (nail polish remover (mainly acetone if you use the non acetone free variety), methylated spirits (a mixture of methanol and ethanol), oil (a mostly non-polar hydrocarbon), glycerin (a fairly complex organic molecule)) are quite complex substances and learners may not have the skills needed to determine the types of intermolecular forces at work here"
1594,You should guide learners in this and tell them the intermolecular forces for these substances
1595,You can help learners work out the strength of the intermolecular forces by telling them that larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces than smaller molecules
1596,This is often a big factor in determining which substance has the strongest intermolecular forces
1597,Each experiment focuses on a different property and sees how that property relates to intermolecular forces
1598,It will often not be easy for learners to see the small differences between some of the molecules chosen and so they need to use a combination of experimental results and knowledge about the strength of the intermolecular force to try and predict what may happen
1599,Each experiment ends with a conclusion about what should be found to guide learners
1600,It is very important to work in a well ventilated room (one with lots of air flow) particularly when working with methanol and ethanol
1601,"Many of the substances used (particularly nail polish remover, ethanol and methylated spirits) are highly flammable and so care must be taken when heating these substances"
1602,It is recommended that learners use a hot plate rather than a Bunsen burner to heat these substances as this reduces the risk of fire
1603,"When doing chemistry experiments it is also extra important to ensure that your learners do not run around, do not try to drink the chemicals, do not eat and drink in the lab, do not throw chemicals on the other learners and in general do act in a responsible and safe way"
1604,The guidelines for safe experimental work can be found in the science skills chapter from grade
1605,From these experiments we can see how intermolecular forces (a microscopic property) affect the macroscopic behaviour of substances
1606,If a substance has weak intermolecular forces then it will evaporate easily
1607,Substances with weak intermolecular forces also have low surface tension and do not rise as far up in narrow tubes as substances with strong intermolecular forces
1608,Substances are more likely to be soluble in liquids with similar intermolecular forces
1609,"We will now look at some more properties (molecular size, viscosity, density, melting and boiling points, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity) in detail"
1610,The carbon atoms link together to form chains of varying lengths
1611,"The boiling point and melting point of these molecules is determined by their molecular structure, and their surface area"
1612,"The more carbon atoms there are in an alkane, the greater the surface area and therefore the higher the boiling point"
1613,The melting point also increases as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases
1614,"there are few carbon atoms), the organic compounds are gases because the intermolecular forces are weak"
1615,"As the number of carbon atoms and the molecular mass increases, the compounds are more likely to be liquids or solids because the intermolecular forces are stronger"
1616,You should see that the larger a molecule is the stronger the intermolecular forces are between its molecules
1617,This is one of the reasons why methane () is a gas at room temperature while pentane () is a liquid and icosane () is a solid
1618,"It is partly the stronger intermolecular forces that explain why petrol (mainly octane ()) is a liquid, while candle wax () is a solid"
1619,If these intermolecular forces did not increase with increasing molecular size we would not be able to put liquid fuel into our cars or use solid candles
1620,Compare how easy it is to pour water and syrup or honey
1621,You can see this if you take a cylinder filled with water and a cylinder filled with glycerin
1622,Drop a small metal ball into each cylinder and note how easy it is for the ball to fall to the bottom
1623,"In the glycerin the ball falls slowly, while in the water it falls faster"
1624,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces are more viscous than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
1625,The solid phase is often the most dense phase (water is one noteworthy exception to this)
1626,This can be explained by the strong intermolecular forces found in a solid
1627,These forces pull the molecules together which results in more molecules in one unit volume than in the liquid or gas phases
1628,The more molecules in a unit volume the denser that substance will be
1629,Substances with weak intermolecular forces will have low melting and boiling points while those with strong intermolecular forces will have high melting and boiling points
1630,"In the experiment on intermolecular forces you investigated the boiling points of several substances, and should have seen that molecules with weaker intermolecular forces have a lower boiling point than molecules with stronger intermolecular forces"
1631,One further point to note is that covalent network structures (recall from grade that these are covalent compounds that form large networks and an example is diamond) will have high melting and boiling points due to the fact that some bonds (i.e
1632,the strong forces between atoms) have to break before the substance can melt
1633,"Covalent molecular substances (eg water, sugar) often have lower melting and boiling points, because of the presence of the weaker intermolecular forces holding these molecules together"
1634,As the alcohol (or mercury) is heated it expands and rises up the tube
1635,This is why when you tile a floor you have to leave gaps between the tiles to allow for expansion
1636,It is also why power lines sag slightly and bridges have slight gaps for expansion
1637,Heat is transferred through a substance from the point being heated to the other end
1638,This is why the bottom of a pot gets hot first (assuming you are heating the pot on a stove plate)
1639,"In metals there are some free, delocalised electrons which can help transfer the heat energy through the metal"
1640,"In covalent molecular compounds there are no free, delocalised electrons and the heat does not travel as easily through the material"
1641,Explain why the melting point of oxygen () is much lower than the melting point of hydrogen chloride
1642,"So if a substance has strong intermolecular forces, then that substance will have a high melting point"
1643,We know that stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher melting points
1644,We also know that oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces than hydrogen chloride (induced dipole versus dipole-dipole forces)
1645,Therefore oxygen will have a lower melting point than hydrogen chloride since oxygen has weaker intermolecular forces
1646,Induced dipole forces are the weakest intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonding is the strongest
1647,In order for a liquid to boil the intermolecular forces must be broken and if the intermolecular forces are very strong then it will take a lot of energy to overcome these forces and so the boiling point will be higher
1648,Water has strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) while carbon tetrachloride only has weaker induced dipole forces
1649,Substances with stronger intermolecular forces take longer to evaporate than substances with weaker intermolecular forces
1650,The type of intermolecular force that can exist when sodium chloride dissolves in methanol is ion-dipole forces
1651,The formation of these forces helps to disrupt the ionic bonds in sodium chloride and so sodium chloride can dissolve in methanol
1652,Tumi and Jason are helping their dad tile the bathroom floor
1653,Their dad tells them to leave small gaps between the tiles
1654,Materials (such as tiles) expand on heating and so small gaps need to be left between the tiles to allow for this expansion
1655,"If Tumi and Jason did not leave these gaps between the tiles, the tiles would soon lift up"
1656,A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of the floor
1657,You might draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor
1658,"This is not exactly accurate — no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam"
1659,"However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically, as we will see in this chapter.We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays"
1660,"Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave.We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms"
1661,The study of how light interacts with materials is called optics
1662,"When dealing with light rays, we are usually interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it"
1663,"From these angles, we can determine, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection"
1664,"You have learnt about the basic properties of waves before, specifically about reflection and refraction"
1665,"In this chapter, you will learn about phenomena that arise with waves in two and three dimensions: diffraction"
1666,We will also build on interference which you have learnt about previously but now in more than one dimension.
1667,The kinetic theory of matter says that all matter is composed of particles which have a certain amount of energy which allows them to move at different speeds depending on the temperature (energy)
1668,There are spaces between the particles and also attractive forces between particles when they come close together.Now we will look at applying the same ideas to gases.The main assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases are as follows: Gases are made up of particles (eg atoms or molecules)
1669,The size of these particles is very small compared to the distance between the particles
1670,The collisions between particles and the walls of the container do not change the kinetic energy of the system
1671,The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
1672,From these assumptions we can define the pressure and temperature of any gas.PressureThe pressure of a gas is a measure of the number of collisions of the gas particles with each other and with the sides of the container that they are in.Video: 23VSTemperatureThe temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.If the gas is heated (i.e
1673,"the temperature increases), the average kinetic energy of the gas particles will increase and if the temperature is decreased, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases"
1674,"If the energy of the particles decreases significantly, the gas liquefies (becomes a liquid).One of the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases is that all particles have a different speed"
1675,For an ideal gas we assume that all particles in the gas have the same speed.So for an ideal gas we can simply talk about the speed of particles
1676,But for a real gas we must use the average speed of all the particles.Video: 23VT
1677,In grade 10 you learnt how to calculate the molar concentration of a solution
1678,The molar concentration of a solution is the number of moles of solute per litre of solvent ()
1679,"This is more commonly given as moles of solute per cubic decimetre of solution ().To calculate concentration we use , where is the molar concentration, is the number of moles and is the volume of the solution.Calculating molar concentrations is useful to determine how much solute we need to add to a given volume of solvent in order to make a standard solution.A standard solution is a solution in which the concentration is known to a high degree of precision"
1680,"When we work with standard solutions we can take the concentration to be constant.When you are busy with these calculations, you will need to remember the following:===, therefore dividing a volume in by will give you the equivalent volume in"
1681,How much sodium chloride (in g) will one need to prepare of a standard solution with a concentration of
1682,The volume must be converted to : To find the mass of we need the molar mass of
1683,We can get this from the periodic table (recall from grade 10 how to calculate the molar mass of a compound).The mass of sodium chloride needed is We will now look at another use of concentration which is for titration calculations.TitrationsA titration is a technique for determining the concentration of an unknown solution
1684,Acid-base reactions and redox reactions are both commonly used for titrations.In grade 10 you did a simple acid-base titration
1685,Now we will look at how to calculate the concentration of an unknown solution using an acid-base titration.When performing a titration we say that the substance of unknown concentration is titrated with the standard solution
1686,A pipette is a measuring device that is used to measure an exact amount of a liquid
1687,If you use a pipette to add liquid to a flask then you would say that the liquid was pipetted into a flask.We can reduce the number of calculations that we have to do in titration calculations by using the following: The and are the stoichiometric coefficients of compounds A and B respectively
1688,It was found that of the sodium hydroxide was needed to neutralise the acid
1689,"Using an acid-base titration, it was found that of this solution was able to completely neutralise of a sodium hydroxide solution"
1690,"First convert the volume into :Then calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid:Now we can calculate the concentration of the sulfuric acid:Remember that only or of the sulfuric acid solution is used.Exercise 8.2See solutions Acetylene () burns in oxygen according to the following reaction: If of acetylene gas is burnt, what volume of carbon dioxide will be produced"
1691,We first work out what mass of magnesium chloride is needed to make a solution with a concentration of
1692,It was found that of the nitric acid was needed to neutralise the base
1693,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
1694,It was found that of the phosphoric acid was needed to neutralise the base
1695,"Write down all the information you know about the reaction, and make sure that the equation is balanced"
1696,of this solution is then pipetted into a conical flask and titrated with hydrochloric acid
1697,It is found that of the hydrochloric acid completely neutralises the antacid solution
1698,Remember that only or of the calcium carbonate solution is used
1699,This chapter builds on the work covered in electrostatics in grade 10

1711,The concept of electromagnetic induction is introduced and some simple calculations using Faraday's law are shown
1712,"Electromagnetism describes the interaction between charges, currents and the electric and magnetic fields to which they give rise"
1713,An electric current creates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field will create a flow of charge
1714,"This has resulted in the invention of many devices which are useful to humans, for example cellular telephones, microwave ovens, radios, televisions and many more."
1715,The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in the real-world
1716,We depend on electricity and electrical appliances to make many things possible in our daily lives
1717,"This becomes very clear when there is a power failure and we can't use the kettle to boil water for tea or coffee, can't use the stove or oven to cook dinner, can't charge our cellphone batteries, watch TV, or use electric lights.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesGraphs - Mathematics, Grade 10, Functions and graphs"
1718,"When a chemical reaction occurs, bonds in the reactants break, while new bonds form in the product"
1719,"Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, according to the following equation:In this reaction, the bond between the two hydrogen atoms in the molecule will break, as will the bond between the oxygen atoms in the molecule"
1720,"New bonds will form between the two hydrogen atoms and the single oxygen atom in the water molecule that is formed as the product.For bonds to break, energy must be absorbed"
1721,The energy that is needed to break a bond is called the bond energy or bond dissociation energy
1722,Bond energies are measured in units of .Bond energy Bond energy is a measure of bond strength in a chemical bond
1723,It is the amount of energy (in ) that is needed to break the chemical bond between two atoms
1724,Remember when we discussed bonding (chapter 3) we used the following energy diagram:We can use this diagram to understand why bond breaking requires energy and bond making releases energy
1725,"When a bond breaks, the atoms move apart and the distance between them increases (i.e"
1726,the atom moves to the right on the -axis or from point X to point A)
1727,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy increases (i.e"
1728,the energy at point A is greater than the energy at point X)
1729,So when a bond breaks energy is needed.When a bond forms the atoms move closer together and the distance between them decreases (i.e
1730,the atom moves to the left on the -axis or from point A to point X)
1731,"Looking at the diagram we see that when this happens, the energy decreases (i.e"
1732,the energy at point X is less than the energy at point A)
1733,So when a bond forms energy is released.Looking at the example of hydrogen reacting with oxygen to form water:We see that energy is needed to break the bonds in the hydrogen molecule and to break the bonds in the oxygen molecule)
1734,And we also see that energy is released when hydrogen and oxygen bond to form water)
1735,"When we look at the entire reaction and consider both bond breaking and bond forming we need to look at the enthalpy of the system.Enthalpy Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a chemical system for a given pressure, and is given the symbol H"
1736,A chemical system is a closed system that contains only the reactants and products involved in the reaction.As we learn about exothermic and endothermic reactions we will see more on the concept of enthalpy.
1737,Up to now you have looked at reactions as starting with the reactants and going to the products
1738,For acids and bases we also need to consider what happens if we swop the reactants and the products around
1739,And that when (the base) gains a proton it forms (the acid)
1740,In your own words explain what is meant by the term conjugate acid-base pair
1741,A conjugate acid-base pair is a reactant and product pair that is transformed into each other through the loss or gain of a proton
1742,So for example an acid loses a proton to form a base
1743,The acid and the resulting base are said to be a conjugate acid-base pair
1744,This chapter looks at the lithosphere and explores mining in more detail
1745,"Mining is very important in South Africa as a large part of the economy depends on gold, diamond and coal mining"
1746,"This chapter looks at the history of mankind, what the lithosphere is, what is in the lithosphere and then goes on to look at mining"
1747,The general techniques used across all types of mining are looked at and then gold mining is explored in greater detail
1748,Learners can do the mining section as a project (either in groups or individually) that they then present to the class
1749,"If learners do a project ensure that each mineral listed in CAPs (iron, phosphate, coal, diamond, copper, platinum, zinc, chrome, asbestos, manganese and gold) is covered by at least one learner in the class.This topic provides a great opportunity to look at social justice and economic concerns"
1750,The various class discussions and debates provided give learners the chance to think about some critical issues in South Africa.In Grade 10 we studied the elements
1751,We learnt about the different elements and the compounds that could be formed from those elements
1752,Where did mankind find them and how has he used them?This chapter will explore the part of the Earth known as the lithosphere
1753,We will find out what the lithosphere is and how the elements are distributed within it.
1754,"In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion, in Grade 11 we learnt about forces and how they can alter the motion of an object"
1755,In this chapter we will focus on what happens when two bodies undergo a contact interaction and how their motion is affected
1756,"We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse.We can begin by considering some scenarios to set the context"
1757,Most people have some intuition for physics based on their everyday experiences but they haven't formalised it
1758,We can use our intuitive answers to lead into more structured thinking about physical events.Momentum transfer doesn't require a contact interaction but we won't consider any non-contact scenarios in this chapter.Everyone has experienced a mosquito landing on their arm and it can happen quite unnoticed
1759,Consider the case of a falcon landing on your arm (ignore the sharp claws for now)
1760,"Would you still notice if the mosquito flew the same way as a falcon, or if the falcon copied the flight of a mosquito before landing"
1761,"You probably would still notice, but try to think about what makes them so different.Look at a motorcycle, motorcar and truck"
1762,"Which of them is more likely to result in less damage in a collision situation, why"
1763,What factors would you change to reduce potential damage.Why is the Moon's orbit largely unaffected when it is hit by asteroid?The factors that come up in these considerations are how fast things are moving and how massive they are
1764,A falcon moving at the same speed as a mosquito still has a much larger mass
1765,"Even if a mosquito moved as fast as a falcon it wouldn't bother us because the mass of a mosquito is so small.If a motorcycle, motorcar and truck were all moving at the same speed then it would be much safer to be in a collision with the motorcycle but a truck doesn't have to be moving as fast as a motorcycle to have a huge impact in a collision because of its large mass.There is an interplay between mass and speed (velocity to be precise) that governs what would happen if these objects came into contact with another object"
1766,"There are two quantities that depend on mass and velocity, kinetic energy and momentum"
1767,Momentum is different to kinetic energy and is what we will focus on in the first part of this chapter
1768,"In the second part we will cover some of the differences between kinetic energy and momentum.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesThe following must be covered by the end of this chapter:Momentum:The definition of momentum.The calculations done on momentum using p = mv and the change in momentum under the influence of a resultant force.The understanding of the vector nature of momentum and the applications concerning momentum.Representing momentum using vector diagrams.Newton's second law expressed in terms of momentum:State Newton's second law in terms of momentum.Expression of Newton's second law in terms of symbols.Emphasis on the vector nature of momentumThe relationship between the net force and change in momentum for a variety of motions by using different examples.Do calculations on the change in momentum when a resultant force acts on an object to change the velocity.Conservation of momentum:Definition of :A systemInternal forcesExternal forcesIsolated systemState the law of conservation of momentum.Explain the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions by using the concept of kinetic energy before and after a collision.Do calculations on the principle of conservation of momentum.Do practical demonstrations on the principle of conservation of momentum.Applications of the principle of conservation of momentum.Impulse:Definition of impulse.The understanding of the vector nature of impulse.The change in momentum and impulse are equal to each other (impulse-momentum theorem).Calculations done by using the impulse-momentum theorem.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, Forces"
1769,"In this chapter we are going to look at the motion of objects that are either projected, thrown, or shot directly into the air, be it vertically upwards, downwards or when objects are dropped"
1770,"This is something that everyone has experienced while playing games and we all have a strong intuition that 'what goes up, must come down', but now we'll study why that is the case.Video: 27JYUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsRectilinear motion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Motion in one dimensionLinear equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesQuadratic equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, FunctionsUnderstand the principle of free falling under gravity with a constant acceleration for an upwards and downwards motion.Know that it's only vertical displacement no horizontal displacement.Always move only under the influence of only gravity.The meaning of time symmetry and the magnitude of velocity.Do an experiment to measure the position and time during a motion.Calculations done on projectiles by knowing how to use a single set of equations.Graphical representations of the equations of motion - Draw graphs for the projectiles motions.Deduct equations and determine the position, displacement, velocity or acceleration from the graphs.Describe the motion of the object from the graphs.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsRectilinear motion - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Motion in one dimensionLinear equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesQuadratic equations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Functions"
1771,"This section studies simple organic molecules, functional groups and the physical properties associated with these functional groups"
1772,"Only molecules with one type of functional group, and no more than three of the same functional group, should be studied"
1773,This section is a basis for any organic chemistry they may study beyond school so it is important that learners have a thorough understanding of this chapter
1774,"Some common polymers are also covered in this chapter, learners should understand the environmental impacts of these polymers as well as their connection with simple organic molecules through the monomers they are formed from.This section of work is the first chemistry chapter of the Grade 12 year"
1775,Learners should have an understanding of intermolecular forces and chemical bonds from Grade 11
1776,"If possible more time could be given here to ensure a thorough understanding, as there is a lot of work to cover.Emphasis should be placed on the different representations of organic compounds: macroscopic, sub-microscopic, symbolic representations and the links between all three"
1777,"Where possible, use atomic model kits to help explain reactions, physical properties and the structure of molecules.The following topics are covered in this chapter"
1778,"What makes a molecule organic, and organic molecular structures This chapter starts with a brief introduction to what makes a molecule organic (containing carbon atoms)"
1779,This then leads in to the properties of carbon that make it so unique
1780,"Learners are introduced to structural, semi-structural, condensed and molecular formula representations for molecules"
1781,It is important that they have a thorough understanding of this before moving on as they will use these representations throughout the chapter
1782,"It is also important that learners understand that molecules are not two-dimensional, if possible do some demonstrations with atomic model kits so they can get a better feel for the shape of an organic molecule"
1783,"Semi-structural representations are not required by CAPS, but will be shown in many textbooks and so it would be good for the student to understand them"
1784,Functional groups Understanding functional groups is essential to understanding organic molecules
1785,"An introduction to each of the required basic functional groups, the homologous series to which they belong, and their general formulas are covered in this section: hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes), alcohols, alkyl halides (specifically haloalkanes), aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters"
1786,"The concept of saturated and unsaturated compounds is also covered, this will become more important later in the chapter when studying reactions"
1787,"Isomers of compounds with the same functional groups, and compounds with different functional groups are also covered"
1788,IUPAC naming A good knowledge of IUPAC naming is very important in organic chemistry
1789,"This section walks the learners through the naming of the functional groups, with many worked examples"
1790,Going through those worked examples and the associated exercises will help the learners understand this section
1791,There are a number of in-class activities provided that will also help with understanding
1792,"The naming of compounds with more than three of the same functional group, or more than one functional group, is not required by CAPS"
1793,"Chain lengths of no more than eight carbon atoms are allowed, and esters may not have branched groups"
1794,Physical propeties and structure A revision of Grade 11 intermolecular forces would be useful before starting this section
1795,The important IMF this year are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces
1796,"The physical properties covered include: viscosity, density, melting and boiling points, flammability and vapour pressure, volatility, physical state, smell"
1797,It would be good for learners to revise molecular shape from Grade 11 as well
1798,"The changes in physical properties are linked to the intermolecular forces of the molecule, which is in turn linked to functional groups, chain length and chain branching"
1799,"Although these are seperated into sections the learner should understand that they are linked (different intermolecular forces are due to functional groups, chain length, etc.)"
1800,Applications of organic chemistry In this section learners will explore the applications of organic molecules
1801,"Specifically the cracking of hydrocarbons, and the (complete) combustion of alkanes"
1802,"Esters are also covered in more detail in this section, with industrial uses"
1803,"Addition, elimination and substitution reactions The learners need to know the addition, elimination and substitution reactions mentioned in this section, including reaction conditions and the major and minor products that will be formed"
1804,"They should understand the difference between an addition reaction, an elimination reaction and a substitution reaction and the reactants required in each specific reaction"
1805,"Plastics and polymers The polymers covered in this section are: polyethene, polypropene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid"
1806,"Learners should understand what makes a compound a polymer, the difference between an addition and a condensation reaction, and how to determine the polymer from the monomer and the monomer from the polymer"
1807,"The learners will be using dangerous chemicals and should be properly instructed on the correct use of safety equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and protective clothing"
1808,They should also be reminded not to sniff any chemicals as the fumes can be dangerous as well
1809,More information on laboratory procedures as well as safety precautions is provided in Chapter 1 (Science skills).These experiments are also an excellent opportunity to get the learners to research organic molecules
1810,Before any experiment the hazards of the chemicals being worked with should be studied
1811,Have the learners do the research for at least some of the experiments before completing them as a way of better understanding the molecules.Do not confuse organic compounds with naturally produced food
1812,Organic compounds are often produced in a laboratory.Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with organic molecules
1813,"An organic molecule is one which contains carbon, although not all compounds that contain carbon are organic molecules"
1814,"Noticeable exceptions are carbon monoxide (), carbon dioxide (), carbonates (eg calcium carbonate), carbides (eg calcium carbide) and cyanides (eg sodium cyanide)"
1815,Pure carbon compounds such as diamond and graphite are also not organic compounds
1816,"Organic molecules can range in size from simple molecules to complex structures containing thousands of atoms!Although carbon is present in all organic compounds, other elements such as hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur and phosphorus are also common in these molecules.Organic moleculeAn organic molecule is a molecule that contains carbon atoms (generally bonded to other carbon atoms as well as hydrogen atoms).Organic compounds are very important in daily life and they range from simple to extremely complex (Figure 4.1)"
1817,"Organic molecules make up a big part of our own bodies, they are in the food we eat and in the clothes we wear"
1818,"Organic compounds are also used to make products such as medicines, plastics, washing powders, dyes, along with a long list of other items"
1819,"There are millions organic compounds found in nature, as well as millions of synthetic (man-made) organic compounds."
1820,"We use the term `work' in everyday conversation to mean many different things.We talk about going to work, doing homework, working in class.Physicists mean something very specific when they talk about work.In Physics we use the term work to describe the process of transferring energy from object or system to another or converting energy from one form to another.You will learn that work and energy are closely related to Newton's laws of motion"
1821,You shall see that the energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another by means of a force
1822,"In other words, an object with lots of energy can do lots of work"
1823,"when object A transfers energy to object B, the energy of object A decreases by the same amount as the energy of object B increases, we say that object A does work on object B"
1824,Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them
1825,Even making an electrical current flow requires that something do work
1826,"Objects or systems must have energy to be able to do work on other objects or systems by transferring some of their energy.Units and unit conversions, Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesForce diagrams - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesVideo: 27RGWork:Define word done on an object by a force.Understand that work is a scalar.Calculations done on the net work done on an object.Understand the difference of positive, negative and no work done.Drawing of force diagrams to determine the net work done on an object - Ignore perpendicular forces.Work-energy theorem:Know the difference between conservative and non-conservative forces.Understand the result of a net force working in on an object.Application of the work-energy theorem to objects on horizontal and inclined planes.Calculations of different motions of objects.Conservation of energy:Definition of conservative and non-conservative forces and examples.Know the relationship between conservative and non-conservative forces and mechanical energy.Calculations done on the conservation of energy.Using calculations to prove the relationship between non-conservative forces and mechanical energy.Power:Definition of power as the rate at which work is done.Calculations done when work is done.Understand what is needed to keep an object moving at a constant speed.Calculations done when an object moves at a constant speed.Calculations done on power.Calculations done on maximum and minimum power.Units and unit conversions, Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesTechniques of vector addition - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Vectors and scalarsNewton's laws - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, ForcesForce diagrams - Physical Sciences, Grade 11, Forces"
1827,"Have you noticed how the pitch of a police car or ambulance siren changes as it passes where you are standing, or how an approaching car or train sounds different to when it is tavelling away from you"
1828,"If you haven't, try to do an experiment by paying extra careful attention the next time it happens to see if you can notice a difference in pitch"
1829,"This doesn't apply to just vehicles and trains but anything that emits waves, be those sound waves or any other electromagnetic (EM) waves.The effect actually occurs if you move towards or away from the source of the sound as well"
1830,"This effect is known as the Doppler effect and will be studied in this chapter.The Doppler effect is named after Johann Christian Andreas Doppler (29 November 1803 - 17 March 1853), an Austrian mathematician and physicist who first explained the phenomenon in 1842.Video: 27SRUnits and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations, Mathematics - Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesSound waves - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, SoundElectromagnetic radiation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Electromagnetic radiationThe Doppler Effect with sound:Definition of the Doppler Effect with examples.Explanation to what happens with sound when objects move relative to each other.Calculations done to determine the frequency when one of the two objects are moving.Description of applications with ultra sound waves.THE Doppler Effect with light:Understand the relationship between light and the Doppler Effect.Application of the Doppler Effect and light concerning the universe.Units and unit conversions - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Science skillsEquations - Mathematics, Grade 10, Equations and inequalitiesSound waves - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, SoundElectromagnetic radiation - Physical Sciences, Grade 10, Electromagnetic radiation"
1831,"A car slowly rusting away, a match burning, a tablet dissolving in water"
1832,All of these are chemical reactions and all of these take place at different rates
1833,"If you were to hold a race between these three reactions you would find that the match wins (it burns quickly), while the car rusting would lose (it may take years to rust).In this chapter we will look at why reactions proceed at different rates (speeds) and how we can change the rate of the reaction.In physics, speed is the scalar measurement that tells us how fast or slow an object is moving (position vs"
1834,For reactions the speed (or rate) of a reaction means how fast or slow the reaction is and indicates the amount of product formed and the amount of reactants used per unit time.
1835,To define chemical equilibrium we need to ask some important questions about reactions: Does a reaction always run its full course so that all the reactants are used up
1836,When all the reactants in a reaction are used up the reaction is said to have gone to completion
1837,Does a reaction always proceed in the same direction or can it be reversed
1838,"In other words, does a reaction always proceed reactants products, or is it possible that a reaction will reverse and go products reactants"
1839,"However, in some reactions the reactants form products (in a ), and the products can change back into reactants (in a )"
1840,"Can a reaction reach a point where reactants are still present, but there does not seem to be any further change taking place in the reaction"
1841,"In all reactions, as the amount of reactant in a reaction decreases the product is formed more slowly"
1842,"In a reversible reaction, as the amount of product increases the reactant is formed more quickly"
1843,Eventually the rate of the forward reaction (reactants products) equals the rate of the reverse reaction (products reactants)
1844,At this point there but there does not appear to be any further change taking place
1845,Chemical equilibrium is the state of a reversible reaction where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1846,While a reaction is in equilibrium the concentration of the reactants and products are constant.Chemical equilibrium A reaction is in chemical equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1847,In the bottle there is carbon dioxide () dissolved in the liquid
1848,There is also gas in the space between the liquid and the cap
1849,"There is a constant movement of from the liquid to the gas phase, and from the gas phase into the liquid"
1850,"However, if you look at the bottle there does not appear to be any change"
1851,The system is in equilibrium.Without chemical equilibrium life as we know it would not be possible
1852,Another example of equilibrium in our everyday lives goes on within our very bodies
1853,"The haemoglobin has to be able to take up oxgen, but also to release it and this is done through changes in the chemical equilibrium of this reaction in different places in our bodies.haemoglobin(aq) + haemoglobin((aq)Haemoglobin, inside red blood cells in the lungs, bonds with oxygen"
1854,This oxyhaemoglobin moves with the red blood cells through the blood stream to cells throughout the body.This video is a good demonstration of how a reaction reaches equilibrium with time.Video: 27VFThe important thing for the students to understand in this experiment is that there is constant movement
1855,"Molecules at the surface of the water in the closed beaker are constantly evaporating, and gas molecules are constantly condensing"
1856,"There is no change in the level of the liquid and the total number molecules in the liquid and the gas state remain constant.Point out that the level of water in the sealed container also drops initially, before finally remaining constant"
1857,This concept will help learners understand how the rate of the forward reaction decreases until equilibrium is reached.Evaporation is when a substance goes from the liquid phase to the gas phase (it evaporates)
1858,Condensation is when a substance goes from the gas phase to the liquid phase (it condenses).The bottle contains water vapour (gas) and water droplets are condensing on the side of the bottle.An open system is one in which matter or energy can flow into or out of the system
1859,"In the liquid-gas demonstration we used, the first beaker was an example of an open system because the beaker could be heated or cooled (a change in energy), and water vapour (the matter) could evaporate from the beaker.Open system An open system is one whose borders allow the movement of energy and matter into and out of the system"
1860,"A closed system is one in which energy can enter or leave, but matter cannot"
1861,The second beaker with the glass cover is an example of a closed system
1862,"The beaker can still be heated or cooled, but water vapour cannot leave the system because the glass cover is a barrier"
1863,Condensation changes the vapour to liquid and returns it to the beaker
1864,"In other words, there is no loss of matter from the system.Generally, some of the molecules at the surface of liquids and solids are moving into the gas phase"
1865,"However, this is such a small fraction of the total volume of the liquid or solid that a reaction involving only solids or liquids can be considered a closed system.It is useful to simplify situations in science by dividing the world into the system we are studying, and the surrounding environment that might influence the reaction, but is not part of it.Closed system A closed system is one in which only energy can move into and out of the system"
1866,Matter cannot be gained by the system nor lost from the system
1867,"In a closed system it is possible for reactions to be reversible, such as in the demonstration above"
1868,"In a closed system, it is also possible for a chemical reaction to reach equilibrium.Some reactions can take place in two directions"
1869,"In the other direction, the products react to form the reactants again"
1870,A special double-headed arrow ( ) is used to show this type of :A reversible reaction A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions
1871,"In other words, the reactants and products of the reaction may reverse roles"
1872,Remember that implies that A goes to B and cannot become A again
1873,"A can go to B and B can go to A.So, in the following reversible reaction: is the reaction.The forward reaction is always taken from the given equation and written: left to right"
1874,is the reaction.The reverse reaction is always taken from the given equation and written: right to left.Exercise 8.1See solutionsWhich of the following situations describes a closed system
1875,The water vapour can leave the pot (system) if there is no lid
1876,Assume that none of the solid or liquid reactants or products go into the gas phase
1877,"Initially (time = ), the rate of the is high (fast)"
1878,As the reaction gets closer to equilibrium the rate of decrease levels out until the forward reaction has a constant rate.Initially the rate of the is low (slow)
1879,"As the reaction progresses the rate of increase levels out until the reverse reaction has a constant rate.At this point the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal and this is called .Although it is not always possible to observe any macroscopic changes, this does not mean that the reaction has stopped"
1880,The forward and reverse reactions continue to take place and so microscopic changes still occur in the system
1881,This state is called dynamic equilibrium.Dynamic equilibrium There is a dynamic equilibrium in a reversible reaction when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
1882,"In the liquid-gas phase equilibrium demonstration, dynamic equilibrium was reached when there was no observable change in the level of the water in the second beaker even though evaporation and condensation continued to take place.For more information on dynamic equilibriums watch this video:Video: 27VJ"
1883,A different concept to strong and weak is the concept of concentrated and dilute
1884,Thus a strong acid can be prepared as either a concentrated or a dilute solution
1885,A solution of which the exact concentration is known is called a standard solution
1886,A concentrated solution is one where a large amount of a substance (solute) has been added to a solvent
1887,Note that both strong and weak acids and bases can be used in concentrated solutions
1888,Concentrated solution A concentrated solution is one where there is a high ratio of dissolved substance (eg acid or base) to solvent
1889,A dilute solution is one where a small amount of a substance has been added to a solvent
1890,Note that both strong and weak acids and bases can be used in dilute solutions
1891,A concentrated solution has a lot of solute molecules (red circles) in the solvent
1892,A dilute solution has few solute molecules (red circles) in the solvent
1893,Dilute solution A dilute solution is one where there is a low ratio of dissolved substance to solvent
1894,A concentrated solution can be made from a strong or a weak acid or base
1895,A dilute solution can also be made from a strong or a weak acid or base
1896,Whether a solution is concentrated or dilute depends on how much of the acid or base was added to the solvent
1897,"A strong base that is also concentrated would be a base that almost completely dissociates when added to a solution, and you also add a large amount of the base to the solution"
1898,"A weak acid that is also dilute would be an acid where only a small percentage of molecules ionise when added to a solution, and you also add only a small amount of the acid to the solution"
1899,The electrical conductivity of a solution depends on the concentration of mobile ions in the solution
1900,"This means that a concentrated solution of a strong acid or base will have a high electrical conductivity, while a dilute solution of a weak acid or base will have a low electrical conductivity"
1901,"Therefore, the more ions (charged particles) there are in a solution, the greater the electric current that can be conducted through the solution by the charged particles"
1902,These include ions in solution and ions in melted ionic materials
1903,Only a small percentage of the molecules dissociate in the solution
1904,Almost complete ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is strong
1905,Only a small amount of ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is weak
1906,"Almost all the molecules ionise in the solution, therefore is a strong acid"
1907,"Only a small percentage of the molecules dissociate, therefore is a weak base"
1908,A concentrated solution has a high ratio of solute to solvent
1909,A dilute solution has a low ratio of solute to solvent
1910,"This is a high ratio, therefore the solution of is concentrated"
1911,"This is a low ratio, therefore the solution of is dilute"
1912,Only a small percentage of the molecules ionise in the solution
1913,Almost complete ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is strong
1914,Only a small amount of ionisation or dissociation means an acid or base is weak
1915,"Almost all the molecules dissociate in the solution, therefore is a strong base"
1916,"Only a small percentage of the molecules ionise, therefore is a weak acid"
1917,A concentrated solution has a high ratio of solute to solvent
1918,A dilute solution has a low ratio of solute to solvent
1919,"This is a low ratio, therefore the solution of is dilute"
1920,"This is a high ratio, therefore the solution of is concentrated"
1921,To do that the molar mass (M) needs to be calculated
1922,M() = ( x ) + + ( x ) =
1923,To do that the molar mass (M) needs to be calculated
1924,For every mole of a solvent there are moles of lithium hydroxide ()
1925,There are many more moles of the base than the solvent
1926,For every moles of a solvent there are moles of nitric acid ()
1927,There are many more moles of the solvent than the acid
1928,% of an unknown acid donates protons when the acid is added to water
1929,This means that it almost completely forms ions in solution and is therefore a strong acid
1930,Is a solution with a pH of strongly or weakly acidic
1931,Although this is a strong acid the solution is only weakly acidic
1932,This means that there must be a very small number of moles of the acid in the total volume of the solution
1933,You need the number of moles (n) and the molar mass (M)
1934,You need the number of moles (n) and the molar mass (M)
1935,"You have the volume (V) and original concentration of the ammonia solution, you need number of moles (n) in that original solution"
1936,Therefore n = C x V n(original solution of ) = x =
1937,The final volume used to calculate the concentration must be the volume of the water plus the volume of ammonia added

2044,This chapter begins by introducing the different basic skeletal types in animals
2045,The link between skeletal structure and function is explored by examining advantages and disadvantages of each skeleton type; and by linking the different skeletal types to various evolutionary adaptations that took place over time.The majority of the chapter focuses on the musculoskeletal systems of humans
2046,There is a large focus on understanding the anatomy of the human skeleton in some detail
2047,"This is followed by a broad overview of the other components of the musculoskeletal system, such as cartilage, joints, tendons, ligaments and muscles"

2051,"For now, you will be introduced to the main features and functions of the human skeleton"
2052,"By focusing on specific structures of the human skeleton, we once more emphasise a common theme of our study of Life Sciences: that structure is related to function.Some of the main types of skeleton found in living things are the hydrostatic skeleton, endoskeleton and exoskeleton"
2053,"Each of these skeletal types have advantages and disadvantages.Skeletal structures are adapted for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial existence where greater support was required.The human skeleton consists of the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.The main functions of the skeleton are to allow for movement, provide protection, provide support, store minerals, produce blood cells and allow for hearing.It is important to understand the relationship between structure and function of bones, cartilage, tendons and ligaments.Joints connect pieces of skeleton and allow independent movement of neighbouring pieces"
2054,"Joints are of three types: fixed, partly movable and freely movable (synovial joints)"
2055,"Synovial joints are of either ball-and-socket, hinge, pivot, or gliding structure.Skeletal muscle is attached to the skeleton through tendons and ligaments"
2056,The structure of voluntary skeletal muscle is made up mainly of myofibrils which allow for muscle contraction
2057,"This contraction is used to move part of the skeleton.Diseases affecting the skeleton include rickets in children, and osteoporosis and arthritis in adults."
2058,"In this chapter, learners will be introduced to the circulatory system in humans"
2059,The chapter starts with an introduction of different types of circulatory systems found in animals.Learners will then spend some time studying the pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems; the internal and external structure of the heart; the cardiac cycle and the different types of blood vessels

2063,"This activity should be conducted in the form of a scientific experiment, with an hypothesis, method, analysis of results and conclusion.All living organisms require oxygen and nutrients, and a method of removing carbon dioxide and waste products"
2064,"However, the circulatory system is not limited to the delivery of nutrients, gas exchange, and waste removal"
2065,"Hormones, too, rely on the circulatory system to reach target organs, and the immune system depends on the transport of white blood cells and antibodies"
2066,"This chapter discusses transport systems found in mammalian systems, with a focus on transport systems found in humans.There are open and closed circulatory systems"
2067,"In an open circulatory system blood enters a cavity, in a closed circulatory system blood remains in vessels"
2068,A double closed circulation system consists of the pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems
2069,In the systemic circulatory system oxygenated blood is transported to the body and deoxygenated returns to the heart
2070,"In the pulmonary circulatory system, deoxygenated blood is sent to the lungs, and oxygenated blood is returned to the heart"
2071,"Specialised cells (sinoatrial node) send signals to the atrioventricular node to cause the atria and ventricles to contact and control the cardiac cycle and heart rate.The structure of blood vessels such as arteries, veins and capillaries are suited to their function"
2072,The lymphatic system transports lymph around the body and returns fluid to the blood circulatory system
2073,"The lymphatic system also plays an important role in immunity.Conditions and diseases of the heart and circulatory system include high and low blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes"

2088,"It is connected with components of the global ecosystem: the hydrosphere, the lithosphere and the atmosphere.Biomes are natural habitats for flora and fauna that extend to both aquatic and terrestrial regions.The location of biomes across southern Africa and in South Africa itself is governed by climate soils and vegetation.The environment consists of interactions between humans with the natural environment.The ecosystem brings together the various interactions between living organismsAbiotic factors affect the nature of an ecosystem"
2089,"Such factors include physiographic factors (altitude, aspect and slope), soil quality (pH, humus content, texture, water retention capacity and air content); light (day length and seasonal changes); temperature (effect of day/night, seasons), water (the water cycle, as well as the nature of wetlands), atmospheric gases, windBiotic factors that affect the ecosystem include producers, consumers and decomposersEnergy flows through the trophic levels of an ecosystem and trace the relationships that exist in an ecosystem.Oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and water also cycle through the ecosystem.Ecotourism presents both opportunities and challenges for the preservation of our ecosystems.In this chapter we will study the way the biosphere interacts with the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere"
2090,This will be followed by a description of the major aquatic and terrestrial biomes in South Africa
2091,We will then learn about the abiotic and biotic factors that make up an ecosystem and examine how these factors interact
2092,"This will be followed by a discussion on energy flow and the different trophic levels in an ecosystem that can be represented by either a chain, pyramid or web"
2093,We will next look at how all the important nutrients are cycled through the environment
2094,"We will conclude this chapter with a discussion of ecotourism in South Africa.The biosphere consists of all the living organisms on Earth.The biosphere interacts with the hydrosphere, the lithosphere and the atmosphere.Biomes are natural habitats for flora and fauna that extend to both aquatic and terrestrial regions.The location of biomes across southern Africa, and in South Africa itself, is governed by climate, soils and vegetation.The environment consists of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components which interact.The ecosystem brings together the various interactions between living organisms.Abiotic factors affect the nature of an ecosystem"
2095,"Such factors include physiographic factors, soil quality, light, temperature, water, atmospheric gases and wind.Biotic factors that affect the ecosystem include producers, consumers and decomposers.Energy flows through the trophic levels of an ecosystem tracing the relationships that exist in an ecosystem.Oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and water also cycle through the ecosystem.Ecotourism presents both opportunities and challenges for the preservation of our ecosystems.atom moleculecelltissueorgansystemorganismecosystem"
2096,So far learners have studied life from the molecular to the ecosystem level
2097,"This chapter examines the fantastic variety of life that exists on Earth, and introduces the systematic way of classifying organisms based on their evolutionary relationships"
2098,"This sets the scene for the next chapter on the 'History of Life on Earth' where we will explore how this variety emerged.There is enormous biodiversity on Earth, consisting of different ecosystems, containing a variety of species, which each have genetic differences.South Africa is a 'hotspot' of diversity and has a large diversity of species endemic to the region.Classification schemes are a way of categorising biodiversity based on common characteristics.The history of classification began with Aristotle.Currently, the most widely used classification system is the five-kingdom scheme consisting of the kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera (or Bacteria)In Science we name living organisms using a naming system called binomial nomenclature, which is written in the form: Genus, speciesBased on cell structure, there are key differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.The main groupings of living organisms are bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and animals.'Biodiversity is the greatest treasure we have"
2099,"— Thomas Eisner, US environmental scientist, who has made interesting findings into how organisms produce chemicals to fight off predation.The diversity of life on Earth has fascinated scientists for generations"
2100,The earliest scientists attempted to understand life by categorising it according to a range of common traits
2101,Over time these classification systems have changed based on the new evidence gathered
2102,"In this unit you will study the history of the system of classifying organisms, starting with Aristotle and progressing to the current five-kingdom system devised by Whittaker"
2103,You will also be introduced to the scientific convention of referring to organisms in Latin using two names - referred to as binomial nomenclature
2104,"It is important to try and draw connections between this section and the previous one in which you studied the plant and animal life common to each biome.There is enormous biodiversity on Earth, consisting of different ecosystems, containing a variety of species, which each have genetic differences.South Africa is a 'hotspot' of diversity and has a large diversity of species endemic to the region.Classification schemes are a way of categorising biodiversity based on common characteristics.The history of classification began with Aristotle.Currently, the most widely used classification system is the five-kingdom scheme consisting of the kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera (or Bacteria).In Science we name living organisms using a naming system called binomial nomenclature, which is written in the form: Genus, speciesBased on cell structure, there are key differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.The main groupings of living organisms are bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and animals"
2105,Each of these categories of organisms have distinctive features that differentiate them.
2106,"In this final chapter, learners will be introduced to the history of life on Earth"
2107,This chapter should be linked to the previous chapters 'Biospheres to Ecosystems' and 'Biodiversity'
2108,"Learners need to understand that biodiversity varies not only from region to region, but also across time"
2109,The biodiversity on Earth at any given time is related to the prevailing climate and geography
2110,"The effect of climate and geography on the type of life forms seen can be linked to the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors that maintain balance in an ecosystem.This chapter makes mention of many dates, and refers to species that may be unfamiliar to learners"
2111,"Apart from a few key events and species (mentioned in the CAPS document) learners need not memorise specific dates or species, but should understand the sequence of events and underlying processes that shaped life on Earth.Key Concepts: Scientists use deductive reasoning to understand fossils and the history of life on Earth"
2112,"Geological events often caused changes in climate, which in turn influence the emergence and disappearance of species.It takes special circumstances for fossils to form, and fossils can be dated by radiometric, radiocarbon or relative dating"
2113,Climate and geography helped shape the evolution of life on Earth
2114,The Cambrian explosion was a rapid explosion in the diversity of life-forms
2115,"Mass extinctions are massive losses in life, and there have been five mass extinction events in history.In the last 4 million years significant changes have occurred in species occurring in Africa, including the evolution of humans.Humans have a massive effect on biodiversity and the natural environment and are partially responsible for the '6th mass extinction'.South Africa is rich in many fossils from diverse time periods"
2116,Fossil tourism is a source of income and employment in fossil localities
2117,In this chapter we will learn about the history of life on Earth
2118,"We will first talk about tools (fossil dating) and theories, (continental drift) that help us understand our past"
2119,"Next we will look at the geological time-scale and discuss three major eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic"
2120,"We will talk about the Cambrian explosion, which was a major explosion in the diversity of life, and we will discuss mass extinctions, which were mass losses in the diversity of life forms"
2121,We will also look at the evolution of humans in the last 4 million years
2122,Throughout the chapter will look at fossil evidence from Southern Africa that originates from key periods in Earth's history.Scientists use deductive reasoning to understand fossils and the history of life on Earth
2123,"Geological events often caused changes in climate, which in turn influence the emergence and disappearance of species.It takes special circumstances for fossils to form, and fossils can be dated by radiometric, radiocarbon or relative dating"
2124,Climate and geography helped shape the evolution of life on Earth
2125,The Cambrian explosion was a rapid explosion in the diversity of life-forms
2126,"Mass extinctions are massive losses in life, and there have been five mass extinction events in history.In the last 4 million years significant changes have occurred in species occurring in Africa, including the evolution of humans.Humans have a massive effect on biodiversity and the natural environment and are partially responsible for the '6th mass extinction'.South Africa is rich in many fossils from diverse time periods"
2127,Fossil tourism is a source of income and employment in fossil localities
