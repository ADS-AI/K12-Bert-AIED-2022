512,among the landed gentry women enjoyed the right to inherit property
513,"the term ‘jungli’ was used to describe those whose livelihood came from hunting, gathering and from forest produces"
514,"it could be done through various sources like colonisation of new lands, by transfers of rights, with the order of the state and by purchase"
515,these were those processes which perhaps permitted lower castes to reach to the ranks of zamindars

525,"the fourth and fifth books (daftars) deal with the religious, literary, and cultural traditions of the people and also contain a collection of akbar’s ‘auspicious sayings’"
526,"despite of its limitations, ain remains an extra ordinary document of that period"
527,"other sources: the other sources included revenue records of gujarat, maharashtra, rajasthan and extensive records of the east india company"
528,all these provided us with useful descriptions of agrarian relations in eastern india
529,"during the mughal period, pesants were called as raiyat and there were two kinds of peasants i.e"
530,khud-kashta were residents of the village in which they held their lands
531,pahi-kashta were non-resident cultivators who belonged to some other village and cultivated lands on contractual basis

539,"the flow of silver and its impact on economy: voyages of discovery and the opening up of the new world resulted in a massive expansion of asia’s, particularly india’s trade with europe"
540,the expanding trade brought in huge amounts of silver bullion into asia to pay for goods procured from india and a large part of that bullion gravitated towards india
541,this was good for india as it did not have natural resources of silver
542,"as a result, the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was marked by a remarkable stability in the silver currency"
543,"caste based village communities: there were three constituents of village community, the cultivators, the panchayat and the village headman (muqaddam or mandal)"
544,caste inequalities were there and certain castes were assigned menial tasks and thus faced poverty
545,"there was a direct correlation between caste, poverty and social status at the lower strata of society"
546,sometimes castes rose in the hierarchy because of their developing economic conditions
547,"in mixed-caste villages the panchayat represented various castes and communities in the village, though village menial-cum-agricultural worker were not included in it the panchayat was headed by a headman known as muqaddam or mandal"

549,the panchayat had the authority to levy fines and inflict punishment

563,"most zamindars had fortresses as well as an armed contingent comprising units of cavalry’, artillery and infantry"
564,"in this period, the relatively ‘lower’ castes entered the rank of zamindars as zamindaris were bought and sold quite briskly"
565,"although, there can be little doubt that zamindars were an exploitative class, their relationship with the peasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism and patronage"
566,"forests and tribes: forest dwellers known as ‘jangli’ were those whose livelihood came from the gathering of forest produce, hunting and shifting agriculture"
567,"sometimes the forest was a subversive place, a place of refuge for troublemakers"

625,but they were sometimes could not understand the sculptures of gods and goddesses with multiple arms and heads or with combinations of human and animal forms
626,art historians have tried to explain the meaning of sculptures with the help of textual references (e.g
627,"many rituals, religious beliefs and practices were not even recorded in a permanent visible form, these were only practised by the respective communities"
628,stupas: buddhist literature mentions several chaityas which are places associated with the buddha’s life
629,"stupa contained relics (bodily remains of buddha or objects used by him) regarded as sacred, the entire stupa came to be venerated as an emblem of both the buddha and buddhism"

635,the great sanchi stupa: the great stupa at sanchi in the state of madhya pradesh is one of the most wonderful ancient buildings
636,19th century europeans were very interested in the stupa at sanchi

638,the discovery of sanchi has transformed our understanding of early buddhism
639,it stands as an example of the successful restoration and preservation of ancient site by the archaeological survey of india
640,"amaravati stupas: in 1854, walter elliot visited amaravati and collected several sculpture panels and discovered the remains of western gateway"

651,now the company began to plan to bring an end to the mughal dynasty
652,the name of the mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the company
653,"in 1849, it was announced that after the death of bahadur shah zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in"
654,"in 1856, the company decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the last mughal king, and after his death his descendants would be called princes"
655,in the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection

657,"the responses to the reforms brought in the indian society by the british were also not positive, although some reforms were essential"

671,"regiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like delhi, kanpur and lucknow"
672,"after them, the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to fight the british"
673,"thus, a widespread revolt shook the british confidence over ruling india"
674,the company had no way out except supressing the revolt with all its might
675,"it brought reinforcement from england, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt"

677,bahadur shah zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment
678,he along with his wife were sent to prison in rangoon

680,the british had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of mass rebellion
681,the british had regained control of the country by the end of 1859 but they could not carry on ruling the land with the same policies anymore
682,the british parliament passed a new act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the east india company to the british crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of indian affairs
683,"the governor-general of india was given the title of viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the crown"
684,in this way the british government took direct responsibility for ruling india
685,"all ruling chiefs of the country were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons"
686,"however, they were made to acknowledge the british queen as their sovereign paramount"
687,"revolt started with an outbreak of mutiny in meerut on 10th may, 1857"
688,"after taking over the local administration, sepoys alongwith people of surrounding village marched to delhi"
689,sepoys came to red fort and demanded that the emperor give them his blessings
690,"revolt of 1857: sepoys’started revolt by capturing the arms from stores and plundering the treasury, afterward they attacked and ransack all government offices like jail, treasury-, telegraph office, record room, bungalows etc"
691,"proclamations in hindi, urdu and persian were put up calling local to join them and exterminate the foreign rule"
692,"when ordinary people joined sepoys, mutiny changed to revolt, the targets of attack widened"
693,"during the revolt in towns like lucknow, kanpur and bareilly, the rich people and moneylenders were also attacked and property were looted, as they were seen as allies of british and they also oppressed the peasants in the recent past"
694,ways of communication during revolt: there have been evidences of communication among the sepoys of different regiments before and during the revolt
695,"sepoys or historians have said, panchayats were there and these were composed of native officers drawn from each regiments"
696,"sepoys shared a common lifestyle and many of them came from the same caste, so they sat together and made their own rebellion"
697,"famous leaders and followers of revolt: to fight the british, leadership and organisation were necessary"
698,"for leadership, rebels turned to those rulers to whom british has overthrown"
699,most of these displaced rulers joined the revolt due to pressure of locals or due to their own zeal
700,at some places religious leaders also took the leadership and inspired people to fight like fakir in meerut and religious leaders in lucknow who preached destruction of british rule
701,"local leader like shah mai in barout, uttar pradesh, and gonoo, a tribal leader of kol tribals in singhbhum mobilised the communities for revolt"
702,the role played by rumours and prophecies in revolt: rumours and prophecies played an important role in outbreak of mutiny and revolt
703,"there was rumour about the cartridge of enfield rifle coated with fat of cow and pigs and mixing of bone, dust with atta"
704,both these rumours were believed and it was thought that it would corrupt the religion and caste of both hindus and muslims
705,there was a fear and suspicion that british wanted indians to convert them to christianity
706,"there was also prophecy in the air that british rule would come to an end on the centenary of battle of plassey on 23rd june, 1857"
707,"so, these rumours and prophecies provided important psychological reasons to revolt against the british rule"
708,"reasons to believe in rumours in the preceding years of f857, many things were introduced by british which were new to indian society and they w’ere believed to be aimed at reforming indian society like introduction of western education, western ideas, institutions, schools, colleges and universities"
709,british formed new laws banning the sati system and to allow widow remarriage
710,"in 1850s, british annexed states like avvadh, jhansi and satara by refusing adoption and on the basis of misgovernment"
711,"these all above factors made indians believe that british is changing the way of their life, custom, rules and replacing them with alien customs and rule"
712,suspicion was further aggravated with rapid spread of christian missionaries and their activities
713,revolt in awadh: lord dalhousie describe the kingdom of awadh as a cherry that will drop into our mouth one day’
714,"gradually, the british developed more interest in the kingdom of awadh"
715,the british were looking at role of awadh as producer of cotton and indigo and also as principal market of upper india
716,"by the 1850’s, british conquered all major areas of india like the maratha lands, the doab, the carnatic, the punjab and bengal"
717,the annexation of awadh in 1856 completed the territorial annexation which started a century earlier with the annexation of bengal
718,dalhousie displaced nawab wazid ali shah and exiled to calcutta on plea that awadh is being misgoverned
719,british government wrongly assume that nawab wazid ali was an unpopular ruler
720,"on the contrary, he w’as widely loved and people bemoaned for the loss of nawab"
721,the removal of nawab led to dissolution of courts and decline of culture
722,"musicians, dancers, poets, cooks, retainers and administrative officials, all lost their livelihood"
723,british raj and the end of o war: with removal of nawab all taluqdar of the awadh were also disposed
724,"with a new revenue system named summary settlement, taluqdar lost their very large share of revenue ; from land"
725,"wherever possible, taluqdars were removed and settlement was done directly with peasants"
726,this dispossession of taluqdar meant the complete break dowm of social order
727,"company directly settled revenue with peasants and revenue now was over assessed, so peasants were troubled"
728,there was no longer any guarantee that in times of hardship or crop failure the revenue demand of the state would be reduced or the peasant would get the loan and support during festivals which they earlier used to get from taluqdar
729,"earlier, british officials had friendly relations with indian sepoys but later indian sepoys were subjected to racial abuse, low pay scale, difference in service"
730,"in 1840s, english officer developed a sense of superiority, physical violence also started and distance between officers and sepoys grew"
731,so local people of awadh were also aware of unfair behaviour meted out to their brothers
732,peasants of awadh were already in trouble because of high revenue and taluqdar were looking for revenge to gain back their authority
733,all these factors cumulatively led to intense participation of people of awadh in revolt of 1857
734,demands of rebels: during the revolt only few proclamations and ‘ishtahars’ (notification) were issued by rebel leader to propagate their ideas and persuade people to join the revolt
735,so it is very difficult to reconstruct what happened in 1857 and what were the demands of rebels
736,the only way to know in detail about revolt of 1857 is by going through details of british officials and to know their point of view
737,proclamation issued by rebel leader appealed to all sections of the population irrespective of cast and creed
738,the rebellion was seen as a war in which both hindus and muslims were equally to lose or gain
739,"it was remarkable that during uprising, religious division between hindus and muslims was hardly noticeable despite the attempt of british government"
740,"rebels against the oppression: british rule ruined the status of peasants, artisans and weavers"
741,there was a sense of fear and suspicion that british were determined to destroy the caste and religion of hindus and muslims and convert them to christianity
742,"proclamation were issued which urged people to come together to save their livelihood, faith, identity and completely reject the things associated with firangi raj"
743,"during the revolt, rebellion attacked all the symbols and office of british government"
744,"rebellion even targeted the allies of british government, ransacked moneylenders property and burnt account books"
745,all the activities reflected an attempt of rebels to overturn traditional hierarchies and rebel against all oppression
746,the search of alternative power: rebels tried to establish pre-british world of 18th century during the revolt
747,they tried to set up whole administrative machinery on one hand to carry out day to day activities during the war and on the other hand they tried to plan how to fight with british
748,"repression by the british: to reconquer north india, british passed series of law"
749,"whole north india was put under martial law, military officers and ordinary britons were given power to punish indian suspected of rebellion"
750,britain government brought reinforcement from britain and arranged double pronged strategy to capture delhi
751,british government faced very stiff resistance in the awadh and they had to use military power at gigantic scale
752,"in awadh, they tried to break unity between landlords and peasants by offering their land back to landlords"
753,description of revolt through art and literature: there are very few records on the rebels point of view
754,most of the narratives of about 1857 revolt were obtained from official account
755,"british officials obviously left their version in diaries, letters, autobiographies and official histories and reports"
756,the stories of the revolt that were published in british newspaper and magazines narrated in detail about the violence of the mutineers and these stories inflamed public feelings and provoked demand for retribution and revenge
757,"paintings, etchings, posters, cartoons, bazaar prints produced by british and indian also served as important record of revolt"
758,many pictures were drawn by the british painters to offer variety of images for different events during the revolt

788,"wechsler: • definition: the global and aggregate capacity of an individual to think rationally, act purposefully, and to deal effectively with his/her environment"
789,"• understood intelligence in terms of its functionality, i.e., its value for adaption to the environment"
790,gardner and sternberg: • an intelligent individual not only adapts to the environment but also actively modifies or shapes it
791,"uni/one-factor theory (alfred binet): • definition: the ability to judge well, understand well, and reason well"
792,• first psychologist who formalised the concept of intelligence in terms of mental operations
793,• conceptualised intelligence as consisting of one similar set of abilities which can be used for solving any or every problem in an individual’s environment
794,two-factor theory (charles spearman) [1927]: • employed a statistical method called factor analysis
795,• intelligence consists of a general factor (g-factor) and specific factors (s-factor)
796,(i) g-factor: it includes mental operations which are primary and common to all performances
797,(ii) s-factor: it includes specific abilities which allow individuals to excel in their respective domains 3
798,"theory of primary mental abilities (louis thurstone): (i) verbal comprehension (grasping meaning of words, concepts, and ideas)"
799,(ii) numerical abilities (speed and accuracy in numerical and computational skills)
800,hierarchical model of intelligence (arthur jensen): abilities operates at two levels: level i – associative learning
801,"[output is equal to input, rote memory] level ii – cognitive competence"
802,"guilford) [1988]: • classifies intellectual traits among three dimensions—operations, contents and products (i) operation: what the respondent does, e.g., cognition, memory retention"
803,"(ii) contents: the nature of materials or information on which intellectual • operations are performed, e.g., visual, auditory"
804,"(iii) products: the form in which information is processed by the respondent, e.g., relations, systems, transformations"
805,• each cell is expected to have at least one (can have more than one) factor or ability and is described in terms of all three dimensions
806,theory of multiple intelligences (howard gardner): • intelligence is not a single entity; distinct types of intelligences exist independent of each other
807,• different types of intelligences interact and work together to find a solution to a problem
808,• studied persons who had shown exceptional abilities in their respective areas and described eight types of intelligence
809,(i) linguistic: the capacity to use language fluently and flexibly to express one’s thinking and understand other
810,"(ii) logical-mathematical: skills in problem solving, thinking logically and critically and abstract reasoning , eigi, scientists"
811,"(iii) spatial: the abilities involved in forming, using and transforming mental images (visual images and patterns), eigi, sculptors, painters, architects, interior decorators"
812,"(iv) musical: the capacity to produce, create and manipulate musical rhythms and patterns"
813,"(v) bodily-kinaesthetic: the use of the whole body or portions of it creatively and flexibly for display, construction of products and problem solving, eigi, athletes, dancers, actors"
814,"(vi) interpersonal: skill of an individual to understand the needs, motives feelings and behaviours of other people for better understanding and relationship"
815,"(vii) intra personal: refers to the awareness of one’s own feelings, motives, desires, knowledge of one’s internal strengths and limitations and using that knowledge to effectively relate to others, eigi, philosophers"
816,"(viii) naturalistic: complete awareness of our relationship with the natural world and sensitivity to the features of the natural world, eigi, botanists, zoologists"
817,"triarchic theory of intelligence (robert sternberg) [1985]: • definition: the ability to adapt, to shape and select environment to accomplish one’s goals and those of one’s society and culture"
818,• three basic types of intelligence: (i) componential intelligence/analytical intelligence: the analysis of informa¬tion to solve problems three components: (a) knowledge acquisition—responsible for learning and acquisition of the ways of doing things
819,(b) meta or higher order component—planning concerning what to do and how to do it
820,(ii) experiential/creative intelligence: using past experiences creatively to solve novel problems
821,— ability to integrate different experiences in an original way to make new discoveries and inventions
822,— quickly find out what information is crucial in a given situation
823,"(iii) contextual/practical intelligence: the ability to deal with environmental demands encountered on a daily basis— — may be called ‘street smartness’ or ‘business sense’ — easily adapt to their present environment/select a more favourable environment, modify the environment to fit their needs"
824,"das, jack nagliery, kirby) [1994] • intellectual activity involves the interdependent functioning of three neurological systems, called the functional units of brain • these units are responsible for— (i) arousal/attention: — arousal and attention enable a person to process information"
825,— an optimal level of arousal focuses our attention to the relevant aspects of a problem
826,— too much or too little arousal would interfere with attention and attend to stimuli
827,"(ii) simultaneous and successive processing: — simultaneous: perceive the relations among various concepts and integrate – them into a meaningful pattern for comprehension, e.g., rspm"
828,"— successive: remember all the information serially so that the recall of one leads to the recall of another, e.g., learning of digits, letters"
829,"(iii) planning: — allows us to think of the possible courses of action, implement them to reach a target, and evaluate their effectiveness"
830,"— if a plan does not work, it is modified to suit the requirements of the task or situation"
831,"• these pass processes operate on a knowledge base developed either formally (by reading, writing, and experimenting) or informally from the environment"
832,"• these processes are interactive and dynamic in nature, yet each has its own distinctive function"
833,cognitive assessment system (cas) (das and nagliery): • battery of tests meant for individuals between 5-18 years of age
834,• consists of verbal as well as non-verbal tasks that measure basic cognitive functions presumed to be independent of schooling
835,• results of assessment can be used to remedy cognitive deficits of children with learning problems
836,individual differences in intelligence: the evidence for hereditary influences on intelligence comes mainly from studies on twins and adopted children
837,"correlation of intelligence • separated early in childhood-—show considerable similarity in their intellectual, personality and behavioural characteristics"
838,• adopted children—children’s intelligence is more similar to their biological rather than adoptive parents
839,"• role of environment—as children grow in age, their intelligence level tends to move closer to that of their adoptive parents"
840,• disadvantaged children—adopted into families with higher socio-economic status exhibit a large increase in their intelligence scores
841,"environmental deprivation lowers intelligence while rich nutrition, good family background, and quality schooling increases intelligence"
842,there is a general consensus among psychologists that intelligence is a product of complex interaction of heredity (nature) and environment (nurture)
843,heredity sets a range within which an individual’s development is actually shaped by the support and opportunities of the environment
844,• assessment of intelligence 1905: alfred binet and theodore simon made the first successful attempt to formally measure intelligence
845,1908: gave the concepts of mental age (ma) is the measure of a person’s intellectual development relative to people of her/his age-group
846,retardation was being two mental age years below the chronological age
847,"1912: william stern, a german psychologist, devised the concept of intelligence quotient (iq)"
848,"formula—mental age divided by chronological age, and multiplied by 100 (to avoid the decimal point)"
849,"• average iq in the population is 100, irrespective of age"
850,"• frequency distribution for the iq scores tends to approximate a bell-shaped curve, called the normal curve—symmetrical around the central value, called the mean"
851,intelligence deficiency (mentally retarded/challenged): the american association on mental deficiency (aamd) views mental retardation as significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behaviour and manifested during the developmental period
852,"in order to be judged as mentally retarded, a person must show: (i) significantly sub average intellectual functioning, e.g., iq below 70"
853,(ii) deficits in adaptive behaviour or the capacity to be independent and deal effectively with one’s environment
854,"deficits must be observed during the developmental period, i.e., between 0-18 years"
855,"mild retardation—development is typically slower than that of their peers but they can function quite independently, hold jobs and families"
856,"level of retardation increases—lag behind their peers in language and motor skills, need to be trained in self-care skills and simple social and communication skills"
857,intellectual giftedness: lewis term an (1925): study to show how intelligence was related to occupational success and life adjustment
858,giftedness is exceptional general ability shown in superior performance in a wide variety of areas
859,"• teacher’s perspective: depends on a combination of high ability, high creativity and high commitment"
860,"• early signs of intellectual superiority: during infancy show larger attention span, good memory, sensitivity to environmental changes, early appearance of language skills"
861,"• other characteristics are advanced logical thinking and problem solving, high speed in processing information, high-level creative thinking, high self-esteem, independence"

865,"‘ culture is a collective system of customs, beliefs, attitudes and achievements in art and literature"
866,sternberg: • notion of contextual or practical intelligence implies that intelligence is a product of culture
867,"vygotsky (russian psychologist): • culture provides a social context in which people live, grow and understand the world around them"
868,"• elementary mental functions (e.g., walking, crying) are universal; the manner in which higher mental functions such as problem-solving and thinking operate are largely culture produced"
869,"• equal attention given to cognitive and non-cognitive processes and their integration: (i) cognitive capacity (sensitivity to context, understanding, discrimination, problem-solving and effective communication)"

885,"• creativity is always reality oriented, appropriate, constructive and socially desirable"
886,• everyday creativity could be seen in terms of the level and the areas in which they exhibit creativity and that all may not be operating at the same level
887,"• researches suggest that children mostly express their imagination through physical activities and in non-verbal ways, although when language and intellectual functions are fully developed and store of knowledge is adequately available then creativity is expressed through verbal modes too"
888,• there is no disagreement that creativity in determined by both heredity and environment
889,"• no amount of training can transform an average person to develop special talent creativity or higher order creativity like tagore, einstein or shakespear"
890,"creativity and intelligence: • certain level of intelligence in necessary to be creative, but a high level of intelligence, however does not ensure that a person would certainly be creative"

1299,with the emergence of the power of zamindars had considerably diminished
1300,so they devised many ways to withstand the pressure and keep their central focus on their zamindaris

1309,the east india company of england established its control in the countryside and implemented its revenue policies
1310,"in this chapter, we will discuss what these policies meant to people and how these changed the daily lives of people"
1311,bengal and the zamindars: colonial rule was first established in bengal
1312,"in bengal, east india company tried to reorder the rural society and establish new land rights and new revenue system"
1313,"there was an auction held at burdwan (present day bardhaman) in 1797, which was popularly known as grand public event"

1318,"the problem of unpaid revenue: the british officials fell that agriculture, trade and the revenue resources of the state could be developed by encouraging investment in agriculture"
1319,this could be done by securing rights of property and permanently fixing the rates of revenue demand
1320,"company felt that when revenue will be fixed, it will provide opportunity to individual to invest in agriculture as a means of making profit and company will also be assured of regular flow of revenue"
1321,"after a prolonged debate amongst company officials, the permanent settlement was made with the rajas and taluqdars of bengal"
1322,"zamindars collected rent from the different villages, paid the revenue to the company, and retained the difference as his income"
1323,reasons for non-payment by zamindars: a number of reasons were responsible for non-repayment of revenue by zamindars which include that revenue demands were kept very high
1324,"it was imposed at a time when prices of agricultural produce was very low, so peasants found it difficult to pay"
1325,"according to this law, zamindars had to pay revenue by sunset of the specified date, otherwise zamindari was liable to be auctioned"
1326,"besides these, permanent settlement and company reduced the power of zamindars"
1327,"limitations imposed on zamindars by the company: zamindars were important for the company but it also wanted to control and regulate them, subdue their authority and restrict their autonomy"
1328,"thus, the zamindars’ troops were disbanded, customs duties abolished and their ‘cutcheries’ (courts) brought under the supervision of a collector appointed by the company"

1341,the accounts of buchanan: francis buchanan undertook detailed surveys of the areas under the jurisdiction of the british east india company
1342,buchanan journey was sponsored by the company and it was planned according to its need
1343,he had specific instruction about what he had to look for and what he had to record
1344,"buchanan observed the stones, rocks, different layers of soil, minerals, and stones that were commercially valuable"
1345,buchanan wrote about landscape and how these landscapes could be transformed and made productive
1346,his assessments were shaped by commercial interest of the company and modern western notions of what constituted progress
1347,"pastoral areas of bengal: with gradual passage of time, settled cultivation expanded and reached to the area of shifting cultivation, swallowing up pasture and forest in the rajmahal hills"
1348,"shifting cultivation was done with the help of hoe, while settled cultivation was done through plough"
1349,"in the hills of rajmahal: francis buchanan, a physician travelled through rajmahal hills and he gave an account about it"
1350,"they lived on hunting, shifting cultivation, food gathering and was intimately connected to forest"
1351,in last decade of 18th century british encouraged forest clearance and zamindar and jotedar also started to turn uncultivated land into rice fields
1352,"as settled agriculture expanded, the area under forest and pasture contracted"
1353,"as the lower hills were takenover by the santhal settlers, the paharias receded interior into the rajmahal hills"
1354,the santhals became settlers: zamindars and britishers after having failed to subdue the paharias and transform them into settled cultivators turned to santhals
1355,"the santhal appeared to be ideal settlers, cleared the forest and ploughed land"
1356,"after land was granted, population of santhals increased exponentially and their villages also increased in number"
1357,"when the santhal were settling, the paharias resisted but were ultimately forced to withdraw deeper into hills"
1358,"santhals now lived a settled life, cultivated a range of commerical crops for market and dealt with traders,’moneylenders"
1359,"but state was taxing them heavily, moneylenders (dikus) were charging high interest rate and taking over their land when debts remained unpaid and zamindars were asserting control over their land"
1360,"later due to problems, santhal revolted in year 1855-1856, and to pacify them, britishers carved out new areas for the santhals and imposed some special laws within it"
1361,the revolt in bombay deccan: one of the way to explore what was happening in the area of bombay deccan is to focus on the revolt of that area
1362,"revolt provide information about life of peasant, event associated with revolt, suppress or control of the revolt"
1363,enquiries about the revolt produced result that can be explored by historians
1364,"through the nineteenth century, peasants in various parts of india rose in revolt against money lenders and grain dealers, e.g"
1365,"a movement began at supa village in poona in 1895, where ryots from surrounding rural areas gathered and attacked the shopkeepers and demanded their bahi khatas (account book) and debt bonds"
1366,"ryots burnt the khatas, looted shop and in few instances burnt the house of sahukars"
1367,later revolt spread from pune to ahmednagar and even further terrified sahukars fled the village leaving behind their property and belonging
1368,"british officials controlled these revolts, they established police post in villages and arrested people and convicted them"
1369,"a new revenue system started: in the 19th century, the british company was keen to expand its financial resources in its annexed territories through other temporary revenue settlement policies"
1370,"this was so, because after 1810, the agricultural prices rose and enlarged the income of the bengal zamindars but not the company"
1371,this was due to the permanent settlement policy in which the revenue demand was fixed and could not be hiked
1372,"therefore to expand its revenue source, company started to introduce temporary settlement"
1373,policies of officials were also shaped by the economic theories they are familiar with
1374,"ricardian idea states that landowner should claim only to average rent and when there is surplus, state should tax that surplus"
1375,he further says if tax will not be levied cultivators will likely to turn into rentiers and surplus income will not be productively invested in improvement of land
1376,ryotwari settlement was introduced in bombay deccan as a new revenue system
1377,"in this system, revenue was directly settled with cultivator or ryot"
1378,"average income from soil, revenue paying capacity of ryot was assessed and proportion of it was fixed as share of the state"
1379,"in this system, there was provision for resurvey of land every 30 years"
1380,"revenue demand and peasant debt: revenue demand was very high and when harvest were poor, it was impossible to pay when peasant failed to pay revenue his crops were seized and fine was imposed on the whole village"
1381,"in 1830’s, prices fell sharply, famine struck and due to this l/3rd of cat tle in deccan were killed and half of human population died"
1382,"so the problem became very severe, but the unpaid revenue mounted"
1383,in these conditions many peasants deserted their village and migrated to new places
1384,"to get over a troubled period, to purchase things for arrange marriages and to start agriculture, peasant needed money"
1385,"but once loan was taken, they were unable to pay it back"
1386,"as debt mounted and loan remained unpaid, peasant dependence on moneylender increased"
1387,"by 1840’s, officials found that peasants were in alarming level of indebtness, so they moderated the revenue demand slightly"
1388,"by 1845, agricultural price recovered steadily and peasants started expanding cultivation"
1389,"but for the purpose of expansion they needed money to buy seeds etc, so they again turned to moneylender for money"
1390,the experience of injustice of the peasants: peasants got deeper and deeper into debt and now they were utterly dependent on moneylender for survival but now moneylenders were refusing their loan
1391,"along with this, there was customary rule that interest charged cannot be more than principal amount of loan"
1392,but in colonial rule this law was broken and now ryots started to see money lenders as devious and deceitful
1393,"to tackle this problem, british in 1859 passed limitation law that stated that loan bond would have validity for 3 years only"
1394,but moneylenders now forced ryot to sign a new bound every 3 years in which total unpaid balance of last loan was entered as principal amount and interest was charged on it
1395,"in petitions to deccan riots commission, ryots stated how moneylenders were suppressing and oppressing them by refusing to give receipts when loan were paid back, entered fictitious figures in bond and forced them to sign and put thumb impression on bonds or document about which they had no idea and they were not able to read"
1396,money lenders also acquired the harvest at low price and ultimately took over property of peasant
1397,they have no choice because to survive they needed loan but inoneylenders were not willing to give it without bonds
1398,the deccan riot’s commission and its report: the government of bombay set up a commission to investigate a riot in deccan
1399,"the commission held enquirers in district where riot spread, recorded statements of ryots, sahukars and eyewitnesses, compiled data on revenue rate, interest rate in different regions and collated reports sent by district collectors"
1400,"it came to one of the conclusion that peasants were angered by moneylenders, not by revenue demand of the company"
1401,it shows that the colonial government was reluctant to admit that popular discontent was against the governments action
1402,official reports are the invaluable source of reconstruction of history but they need to juxtaposed with other evidences also
1403,cotton and its global condition: the american civil war broke in 1861
1404,"to reduce dependence on america, cotton cultivation was promoted in india"
1405,export merchants gave money to urban sahukars who in turn gave to rural moneylenders to secure the produce
1406,"so now the peasant had access to money easily and due to this, cotton production increased rapidly"
1407,but this brought prosperity to rich peasants mostly and for small peasants it led to heavier debt
1408,by 1862 over 90 percent of cotton imports into britain were coming from india
1409,"when in 1865 civil war ended, export of cotton resumed, prices of cotton and demand of cotton from india decreased"
1410,"thus merchants, sahukars and moneylenders were not extending credit to peasants, instead they demanded repayment of debts"
1411,at the same time revenue demand was also increased from 50 to 100 percent
1412,class 12 history notes chapter 10 important terms: mahals: estates owned by big zamindars who were called raja locally

1429,both the moderates and the radicals unitedly oppressed the british action
1430,"this led to the birth of the swadeshi movement, which boycotted british institutions and goods"
1431,an important development came in 1906 with the formation of the all india muslim league at dacca
1432,the founder members of the league were muslim landlords and nawabs

1446,"gandhiji supported their call and urged the congress to campaign against jallianwala massacre, and demand swaraj"
1447,"during the years 1921-22, the non-cooperation movement gained momentum because it got a wide support"
1448,"however, it was abruptly called off by mahatma gandhi when on february 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in chauri chaura"
1449,it hurt mahatma gandhi because he had never thought that people would go violent
1450,he always wished to drive away the british by violent methods
1451,the congress now resolved to fight for purna swaraj (complete independence under the presidentship of jawaharlal nehru

1456,the league began to think that muslims were a minority and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure
1457,the congress’s rejection of the leagues desire to form a joint congress-league government in the united provinces in 1937 further annoyed the league
1458,"in 1945, the british opened negotiations between the congress, the league and themselves for the independence of india"
1459,"in march 1946, the british cabinet sent a three-member mission to delhi to examine the league’s demand for pakistan and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free india"
1460,the mission suggested that india should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for muslim majority areas
1461,the violence of partition shook both the newly- independent countries—india and pakistan
1462,beginning of gandhian era: some times in the history of nationalism an individual with his contribution is identified with the making of a nation
1463,gandhi came back to india in january 1915 after leading successful struggle against discriminatory and oppressive policy of british in south africa
1464,"for the first time, gandhi started satyagraha in south africa (non-violent protest ) and promoted harmony between different religious communities"
1465,"when gandhi came back to india, he realised that india become politically more active"
1466,congress had made its reach to major towns and cities and swadeshi movement greatly broadened national movements appeal among middle classes
1467,gandhiji’s first major public appearance in india was at opening of banaras hindu university (bhu) in 1916
1468,"during his speech, gandhiji charged the indian elite with a lack of concern for the labouring poor sections of our society"
1469,"gandhiji said “there can be no spirit of self-government if we take away or allow other to ’ take away from the peasant almost the whole result of their labour.” gandhiji’s speech at one level was a statement of the fact that indian nationalism was an elite phenomenon in which lawyers, doctors and landlords were mostly involved"
1470,but he wanted that indian national movement should represent indian people as a whole
1471,"gandhi as a people’s leader: gandhiji made the freedom struggle and national movement representative of masses.movement transcended from elite to peasants, working class and encompassed every section of society"

1480,"he believed that india need to be free from evils of untouchability, child marriage, to cultivate a genuine tolerance for one another and religious harmony"
1481,"he stressed the indian’s need to be self-reliant on the economic front, so he promoted khadi and was against mill-made clothes"
1482,"background of national movements in india: in 1917, gandhiji successfully led champaran movement"
1483,through this movement he wanted to seek security of the peasants and their freedom to cultivate crop of their choice
1484,"in 1918, he led a strike demanding for better working conditions for the textile mill workers in ahmedabad and other peasant movement asking the state for the remission of taxes in kheda"

1488,"in april 1919, repressive policy took very ugly and tremendous turn when british brigadier dyer ordered his troops to fire on peaceful assembly at jallianwalah bagh in amritsar"
1489,this shocked the nation and very deep resentment and anger was brewing inside indians
1490,it was the rowlatt satyagraha that made gandhiji a true national leader
1491,"emboldened by its success, gandhji called for campaign of non-cooperation with british rule"
1492,indians were asked to renunciate all voluntary associations with british government
1493,"gandhiji believed if non-cooperation was carried effectively, british would leave the country within a year"
1494,khilafat and non-cooperation movement: to further strengthen the movement and unity among fellow indians he joined hand with khilafat movement
1495,khilafat movement was led by mohammad ali and shaukat ali and it demanded restoration of the respect of the caliphate
1496,"according to gandhiji by intermixing of non-cooperation and khilafat movement, the two major religious commuities i.e"
1497,hindus and muslims could collectively bring an end to colonial rule
1498,"students refused to go to schools, colleges, lawyers stopped to going courts, working class went on strike, tribes in andhra pradesh violated forest laws and farmers in awadh stopped paying taxes"
1499,"american biographer of mahatma gandhiji, louis fisher wrote “non-cooperation became the name of an epoch in the life of india and gandhiji"
1500,it was negative enough to be peaceful but positive enough to be effective
1501,it w’as training for self-rule.” due to this movement british government was shaken
1502,"in february 1922, gandhiji called off non-cooperation movement due to untowards incident of burning of police stations in chauri chaura in which several constables were burnt to death"

1507,"in this session “purna swaraj” was proclaimed as motto, and on 26th january, 1930 republic day was observed"
1508,"dandi (salt) march: after republic day observance, gandhiji announced his plan of march to break salt law"
1509,"this law was widely disliked by indians, as it gave state a monopoly in manufacture and sale of salt"
1510,"on 12th march, 1930 gandhiji began his march from ashram to ocean"

2035,there is also positive growth of population which happens when birth rate is more than death rate and negative growth of population when birth rate is lower than death rate
2036,"components of population change there are three components of population change i.e., births, deaths and migration"
2037,crude birth rate [cbr] number of births in a year per thousand of population is expressed as crude birth rate (cbr)

2057,"second stage level of technology increases and other facilities like medical, health, sanitation improves due to which the death rate reduces"
2058,but the fertility rate and birth rate remains high due to which there is huge rise in population
2059,population expands rapidly as there is wide gap between birth and death rate

2249,"while selecting the mode of transport, distance, time and cost are seen."
2250,"distance can be measured as km distance, time taken to travel particular route as time distance, expense of travelling on a route as cost distance"
2251,factors affecting transport demand and routes are two major factors which affect transport services
2252,demand transport depends on the size of population and standard of living of people
2253,"the larger the population size, the greater is the demand for transport"
2254,"route it refers to the transport network depend on location of cities, towns, villages, industrial centres, availability of raw materials, nature of landscape, type of climate, availability of funds, etc"
2255,network a network is a well developed transport system that is made up of nodes and links
2256,a node is a meeting point of two or more routes and every road that joins any two nodes is called a link
2257,"communication communication services involve in the transmission of words, messages, facts and ideas"
2258,"the development of transport facilitated communication as messages were carried by hand, animals, boat, road, rail and air"
2259,"but new technology has made communication independent of transport, such as mobiles, telephony and satellites"
2260,"some of the communication services are discussed below: telecommunications the development of modem technology has revolutionised communication and it has become direct and instantaneous, e.g"
2261,"telegraph, morse code and telex in last century and now satellites, mobile, telephony, etc are used"
2262,"mass media communication means through which messages could be sent to vast audiences around the world are called mass media, e.g"
2263,services there are different levels at which services are provided and availed
2264,"some are meant for industry, some for people, and some for both industry and people i.e., transport"

2268,"some services are supervised and/or regulated by government like making, maintaining highways, bridges, fire fighting departments, education, healthcare, etc"
2269,"thus, services are present in organised sector that is government owned or big corporations"
2270,some are present in unorganised sector like low order and domestic services
2271,mumbai’s dabbawala in india is one such service of unorganised sector
2272,people engaged in tertiary activities earlier more number of people were employed in t he primary and secondary sector as these sectors provided more jobs
2273,"but, now there has been a shift of jobs to tertiary or service sector"
2274,"in developed countries, a higher percentage of workers are employed in providing services as compared to less developed countries"
2275,some selected examples some of the selected examples that are related to the people engaged in tertiary activities are as follows: % tourism tourism is part of service sector that refers to travel undertaken for purpose of recreation rather than business
2276,"this industry generates jobs as people are engaged in providing accommodation, meals, transport, entertairment, infrastructure retail trading and crafts"
2277,"tourist regions tourism can be seasonal or throughout the year like warmer places around the mediterranean coast, west coast of india during winters, mountains in summers or winter spots regions found mainly in mountainous areas"
2278,"historic towns, religious places, heritage sites offer tourism throughout the year"
2279,factors affecting tourism the rise in tourism industry is due to increased demand for it which is thus influenced by improvement in standard of living and increased leisure time
2280,another factor is improvement in transportation that has made travel easier and destinations reachable
2281,tourist attractions tourist attractions are specific features of a place that attract people
2282,"these are as follows: climate in winter holidays, areas having warm sunny weather is preferred like beaches in southern europe, so it attracts more number of tourists there"
2283,"landscape mountains, lakes, spectacular sea coasts and landscapes not completely altered by man are good tourist attractions"
2284,"history and art ancient or picturesque towns, archaeological sites, historically important places having castles and palaces attract tourists"
2285,culture and economy areas having rich cultures attract people as they go their to experience ethnic and local customs
2286,"places giving economic benefits are also attractions such as cheap home stays in goa, madikere and coorg in karnataka"
2287,medical services for overseas patients in india medical services or tourism takes place when medical treatment is combined with international tourism activity

2309,early man lived in forests and sustained his life by hunting animals
2310,he has also been gathering various products from the forests to satisfy his needs in early days
2311,"thus, early men sustained on edible plants which they hunted and edible plants which they gathered from the forests"
2312,"early human beings practised these activities with the help of primitive tools, made of stones, twigs or arrows, so the number of animals killed was limited"
2313,but now modem equipments led to the widespread poaching of animals due to which hunting is declared illegal
2314,"gathering is practised in high latitude zones oi north canada, northern eurasia and southern chile, low latitude zones of amazon basin, tropical africa, interiors of south-east asia"
2315,this activity requires small capital investment and low level of technology
2316,"valuable plants, leaves, bark, etc are collected and after simple processing they are sold in local markets"
2317,these products cannot compete the world market as synthetic products are lower in price and of better quality
2318,this is carried either at subsistence level known as nomadic herding or at commercial level known as commercial livestock rearing
2319,"nomadic herding also called pastoral nomadism, it is a primitive activity where herders move with their livestock from one place to another in search of food and water"
2320,"they rely on animals for food, clothing, shelter, tools and transport"
2321,"depending on geographical factors different animals are reared in different regions like cattle in tropical africa, sheep, goat and camel in sahara, asiatic deserts, yak, llamas in tibet and andes, reindeer in arctic and sub-arctic areas"

2328,"based on methods of farming, different type of crops are grown and livestock raised"
2329,"the following are the main agricultural systems: subsistence agriculture in this type of agriculture, farmers consume all or nearly all of the produce as the size of the farm is very small"
2330,it can be divided into primitive subsistence agriculture and intensive subsistence agriculture
2331,"primitive subsistence agriculture this is widely practised in tropical areas of africa/south, central america and south-east asia"
2332,"different names are given to it in different places like milpa, jhuming, ladang"
2333,it is also called slash and bum agriculture or shifting agriculture
2334,cultivation is done through primitive tools by clearing a patch of land
2335,"after 3 to 5 years, when the soil loses its fertility then new land is cleared for cultivation"
2336,intensive subsistence agriculture this type of agriculture is practised in densely populated regions of monsoon asia
2337,this type of cultivation is either dominated by wet paddy cultivation and crops other than paddy
2338,"the per unit area is high but productivity is low as land holdings are small due to high density of population, less use of machines, family labour involved and farm yard manures are used"

2359,"the distance between the farms and urban markets can be covered through trucks overnight, hence its name is known as ‘truck farming.’ factory farming this refers to livestock rearing mainly poultry and cattle"
2360,it is practised in industrial regions of europe and north america
2361,co-operative farming under this farming group of farmers form a co-operative society by pooling their resources voluntarily for more efficient and profitable farming
2362,there is help from societies in buying and selling farm products
2363,collected farming it is based on social ownership of the means of production and collective labour
2364,"here farmers pool their resources, though they are allowed to keep a small part with themselves"

2529,productivity it means human labour which must be enriched by building capabilities in people
2530,empowerment it means having the power to make choices which is possible by increasing freedom and capability
2531,approaches to human development there are four ways of looking at or approach the problems of human development
2532,some of the important approaches are: income approach this approach links the development to incomes as it believes that income determines the level of freedom that one enjoys
2533,"welfare approach under this approach, government is responsible for providing basic facilities like health, education and amenities to people"
2534,"basic needs approach in this approach, emphasis is on providing six basic needs i.e"
2535,"amartya sen and aims to build human capabilities in health, education and-access to resources in order to increase human development"
2536,"measuring human development following are the ways of measuring human development human development index human development is measured through human development index (hdi) which ranks the countries between 0 to 1 based on their performance in the key areas of health, education and access to resources"
2537,"it is the sum total of the weights assigned to health, education and access to resources"
2538,"indicator to access health is life expectancy at birth, to access knowledge it is adult literacy rate and gross enrollment ratio and resources are measured in terms of purchasing power human poverty index this index measures the shortfall in human development"
2539,"the index is based on the probability of not surviving till 40, adult literacy rate, people not having access to clean drinking water and number of underweight children"
2540,"united nations development programme the united nations development programme (undp) since 1990, publishes the human development report by measuring the human development index and human poverty index"
2541,gross national happiness this is gross national happiness (gnh) which is another measure of accessing human development and bhutan is the only country in the world to measure the country’s progress through gnh
2542,"international comparisons on comparing the human development of different countries, it is revealed that the size of the territory and per capita income are not directly related to human development"
2543,"for comparisons, the countries are classified into four groups on the basis of human development scores earned by them"
2544,very high level of human development the countries scoring above 0.802 are categorised under it
2545,"top ten countries with very high value index are norway, australia, netherlands, united states, new zealand, canada, ireland, liechtenstein, germany and sweden"
2546,the countries in this group provide education and healthcare which is an important government priority as well as invest a lot in the social sector
2547,high level of human development countries scoring between 0.702 and 0.801 are grouped under it
2548,good governance and lot of investment in social sector has led to high level of human development in these countries
2549,medium level of human development countries scoring between 0.555 and 0.701 are grouped under it and there are 39 countries in this group
2550,‘ many of these countries were former colonies and are facing political instability as well as high social diversity
2551,low level of human development countries scoring below 0.554 are grouped under it and there are 44 countries in it
2552,"these countries are going through political turmoil, social instability, civil war, famine or high incidence of diseases"
2553,"internal comparisons reveal that the culture, religion or community are non-determinants of human development"
2554,"rather, pattern of government expenditure on the social sector, political environment, amount of freedom people have and the distribution of resources play a decisive role in the level of human development"
2555,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 4 human development will help you
2556,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 4 human development, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2557,"physical features these include nature of terrain, altitude, climate and availability of water"
2558,"cultural and ethnic factors these include social structure, caste and religion"
2559,types of rural settlements types of the rural settlements are determined by the above determinants as well as by the extent of the built up area and inter-house distance
2560,"in india, rural settlements can broadly divided into four types: clustered, agglomerated or nucleated semi-dustered or fragmented hamleted, and dispersed or isolated clustered settlements the houses in this settlement are closely spaced or have no space between houses"
2561,"the living place is distinct and separated from the surrounding farms, bams and pastures"
2562,"the settlement sometimes present distinct patterns or geometrical shapes like rectangular, radial, linear, etc which are recognisable in fertile alluvial plains and north-eastern states"
2563,"this type of settlement is built due to various reasons, e.g"
2564,"in bundelkhand and nagaland, people live in these settlements for defence and security purposes, in rajasthan these settlements are built around/ near water resources due to water scarcity"
2565,semi-clustered settlements this type of settlement develops by the concentration of houses in a restricted area of a dispersed settlement or develop due to segregation or fragmentation of a large compact village
2566,"here, a dominant community captures the most important part in main village and force other communities to live away"
2567,"hamleted settlement this type of settlement is formed due to social or ethnic factors and thus known for different identity and name, like, panna, para, nagla, dhani etc"
2568,each hamlet is a unit and has a number of houses
2569,"middle and lower ganga plain, chhattisgarh and lower valleys of himalayas"
2570,dispersed settlements isolated huts or hamlets of few huts in remote jungles or on small hills with farms or pastures are characteristics of dispersed type of settlement
2571,"urban settlements unlike rural settlement, urban settlement are usually more dense, compact and larger in size"
2572,"cities and towns both are connected directly or indirectly with villages and also with each other and exchange goods, services and also commute"
2573,"evolution of towns in india the evolution of towns started in india from prehistoric times, e.g"
2574,"indian towns may be classified into three groups on the basis of their evolution in different periods: ancient towns these towns were developed over 2000 years ago by the various kings as religious and cultural centres, e.g"
2575,medieval towns these towns were developed as headquarters of principalities and kingdoms by medieval kings and sultans of india
2576,these towns are about 100 in numbers and were generally fort towns which came up on the ruins of ancient towns
2577,modern towns these towns were developed by the britishers and other europeans in india
2578,these are further divided into the following groups: port towns these are located on the coastal areas of india i.e
2579,"some other towns of european styles these towns include hill stations for summer resorts, military towns and small towns for administrative purposes"
2580,"towns after independence after independence, some towns were also developed like: administrative headquarters or capital of states these towns include chandigarh, bhubaneshwar, gandhinagar and dispur etc"
2581,"satellite towns these were old towns which developed around metropolitan cities such as ghaziabad, rohtak, gurgaon (gurugram), etc"
2582,medium and small towns these are developed due to increasing investment in rural areas
2583,urbanisation in india urbanisation is the transition of rural population into urban population
2584,it is measured by the percentage of urban population into total population
2585,"in india, the level of urbanisation is very low, as it was just 28% in 2001"
2586,"although, urbanisation in india is increasing with high rate, as it increased 11 times dining twentieth century, but this process is comparatively slow during recent two decades"
2587,classification of towns on the basis of population size census of india is responsible for defining and classifying urban areas in india
2588,cities and urban areas are classified into six classes by census of india
2589,"thus, an urban area that have population of more than one lakh is considered as city or class i town"
2590,cities that have population more than one million but less than 5 million are considered as metropolitan or metro city
2591,cities that have population more than 5 million are considered as ‘megacities’ or ‘megalopolis’
2592,"the six classes of towns are given below apart from these cities, there is also a concept of urban agglomeration in india"
2593,"according to census of india, an urban agglomeration may have to fulfil anyone of the following conditions: a town and its adjoining urban out growths"
2594,a city and one or more adjoining towns with their outgrowths together forming a contiguous spread
2595,"examples of these outgrowth may be in the form of railway colonies, university campus, part area, military cantonment, etc"
2596,"according to the given table, class iv cities are highest in number but larger proportion of urban population lives in class i cities (61.48%)"
2597,six of them are mega cities with population over 5 million each
2598,"greater mumbai being the largest urban agglomeration with 16.4 million population, followed by kolkata, delhi, chennai, bengaluru, and hyderabad"
2599,"functional classification of towns apart from population size, indian towns and cities can be classified into the following heads on the basis of their functions (dominant economic activity): administrative towns and cities these towns work as headquarter for surrounding region"
2600,"government offices and departments, etc are mainly concentrated in these cities"
2601,"chandigarh, new delhi, bhopal, shilong, guwahati, imphal, srinagar, gandhinagar, jaipur and chennai, etc"
2602,port towns are examples of these towns that are always busy in transporting commodities to other cities
2603,"there are some cities which are hubs of inland transport such as agra, dhulia, mughal sarai, itarsi, katni, etc"
2604,commercial towns the important functions of these towns are trade and commerce
2605,garrison cantonment towns these towns are meant for the army or defence purpose
2606,"educational towns initially these towns were important education centres, but later they emerged as major campus towns"
2607,"religious and cultural towns these towns are famous for pilgrimage, religious worship or old cultures"
2608,"varanasi, mathura, amritsar, madurai, pune, ajmer, tirupati, kurukshetra, haridwar, ujjain, etc"
2609,tourists towns these towns are famous for attracting wide range of tourists from india and all over the world
2610,"nainital, mussoorie, shimla, pachmarhi, jodhpur, jaisalmer, udagamandalam (ooty), mount abu, etc"
2611,the functions of these cities are not fix and change with the time as cities are dynamic in nature
2612,"thus, classification of these cities on the basis of specialised function is impossible as all the functions are interlinked"
2613,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 14 human settlements will help you
2614,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 14 human settlements, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2615,"a person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions is known as ‘migrant’ there are two types of migrants on the basis of enumeration of census: life-time migrant if a person’s place of birth is different from the place of census enumeration, then he is known as lifetime migrants"
2616,"as per census 2001, this group reported 307 million persons (30%) and as per 2011, this group reported 36.7%"
2617,"migrant by place of last residence if a person’s place of last residence is different from the place of enumeration, then he is known as migrant by place of last residence"
2618,"as per census 2001, this group reported 315 million migrants (31 percent)"
2619,"according to 2011 census, £5.36 crore migrants (37%) and settled in a place different from their last residence"
2620,"streams or types of migration in general, there are two types of migration: internal migration it refers to the movement of people within a country or nation"
2621,"there are four streams of migration identified under the internal migration: rural to rural (r-r) rural to urban (r-u) urban to urban (u-u) urban to rural (u-r) women migrants are highest in both intra-state and inter-state migration, short distance rural to rural migration stream because of their marriage"
2622,whereas male migrants are highest in rural to urban streams of inter-state migration due to the economic reasons
2623,international migration it refers to the movement of people out of the country or out of the geopolitical border
2624,india experiences large number of international migration mostly from neighboring countries
2625,"as per census 2001, there were more than 5 million persons reported from other countries in india"
2626,"out of these 96% came from the neighbouring countries as: bangladesh   – 3.0 million pakistan        – 0.9 million nepal             – 0.5 million spatial variation in migration in india, there is an uneven spatial variation in migration in terms of in-migration and out-migration"
2627,states receiving high number of in-migrants maharashtra is the largest migrants receiving state (2.3 million)
2628,"besides this, delhi, gujarat, haryana and other urbanised areas attract high number of migrants"
2629,"states with high out-migrants uttar pradesh (-2.6 million), bihar (-1.7 million) and some other backward states have largest number of net out"
2630,causes of migration the reasons/causes of migration can be put under two categories: push factors these are factors which urges people to leave their place of residence or origin
2631,"some of them are as follows: natural disaster like flood, drought, cyclonic storms, earthquake, tsunami, etc"
2632,pull factors these refers to factors which attract the people from different places
2633,"according to an estimation, about 38% males migrate for work and employment whereas only 3% female migrate for the same reason"
2634,(but according to census 2011 there is a downfall of 4.2% as compared to 2001 census)
2635,"about 65% (69.7% according to 2011 census) of women migrate because of marriage, whereas only 2% males migrate"
2636,consequences of migration migration is a consequence of the uneven – distribution of opportunities over space
2637,people : tends to move from place of low opportunity and low safety to the place of higher opportunity and ; better safety
2638,"results can be observed in i economic, social, cultural, political and, demographic terms"
2639,economic consequences these consequences are positive as well as negative: positive remittances are important for economy of a country
2640,"as migrants sent remittances to their family members for food, repayment of loans/debts, treatment, marriages, children’s education, agricultural inputs, construction of houses, etc"
2641,"green revolution in the rural areas of punjab, haryana, western uttar pradesh was a success because of the migrants from rural areas of ‘ eastern uttar pradesh, bihar, madhya pradesh and odisha"
2642,"development of unhygienic slums in industrially developed states like maharashtra, gujarat, karnataka, tamil nadu and delhi"
2643,demographic consequences these consequences can be both positive or negative: positive redistributing of population within a country
2644,age and skill selective out migration created an imbalance in demographic structure of rural areas
2645,"age and sex-composition is seriously affected in states of uttarakhand, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and eastern maharashtra due to migration"
2646,social consequences these consequences are both positive as well as negative: positive migrants work as an agent of social change
2647,"they diffuse new ideas of science and technology, family planning, girls education, etc from one place to another place"
2648,people also bring different cultures with them which help to break the narrow considerations and broaden up the mental horizon of the people
2649,negative anonymity increases and creates social vacuum and feeling of ejection
2650,"this feeling ultimately results in anti-social activities such as crime, drug abuse, theft, etc"
2651,environmental consequences negative large scale rural-urban migration leads to overcrowding in the cities and puts tremendous pressure on the infrastructure
2652,it also results in unplanned and haphazard growth of cities in which slums and shanty colonies are very common
2653,"overcrowding is also related to over-exploitation of natural resources and cities are facing serious problems of water shortage, air and water pollution, problem of sewage disposal and management of solid wastes"
2654,"other consequences when male migrants leave their wives in rural areas, this puts extra physical and mental pressure on women"
2655,"migration of women for education and employment gives them more freedom, on the other hand it also adds to their vulnerability we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 12 migration: types, causes and consequences will help you"
2656,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 12 migration: types, causes and consequences, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2657,"india contributes about 2.45% world’s geographical area, the 4% of the world’s water resources and about 16% of world population"
2658,but only 60% (1122 cubic km) from these two sources of water are beneficial and usable
2659,"surface water resources river, lakes, ponds and tanks are four main sources of surface water resources in india"
2660,"about 10,360 number of river and tributaries existed here and each tributary is more than 1.6 km long"
2661,"the mean annual flow in all the river basin in india is estimated to be 1,869 cubic km"
2662,"but only about 690 cubic km or 32% of these water can be utilised due to topographical, hydrological and other constraints"
2663,size of catchment area/river basin and rainfall in its catchment area control the flow of water in a river
2664,water availability in rivers is more during monsoon than other seasons in india
2665,"catchment areas of ganga and brahmaputra and barak rivers fall into the high rainfall receiving area thus, have 60% of total water resources and have only 33% of the surface areas in india, but most of the water is not utilised"
2666,"on the other hand, in the peninsular rivers like godavari, krishna, kaveri, etc mean annual flow of water is less, but much of their water resources has been utilised"
2667,groundwater resources there is about 432 cubic km of total replenishable ground water resources available in india
2668,ganga and brahmaputra basins have about 46% of the total replenishable groundwater resources
2669,the level of groundwater utilisation is relatively high in the river basins of north¬western parts and southern parts of india
2670,"states having very high utilisation of groundwater are punjab, haryana, rajasthan and tamil nadu"
2671,"states having moderate utilisation ground water are gujarat, uttar pradesh, bihar, tripura and maharashtsa"
2672,"states having low utilisation of groundwater are chhattisgarh, odisha, kerala, etc"
2673,"it is assumed that if the utilisation of water continue with the present rate, there are chances that it will limit the development and create a situation of social upheaval disruptions"
2674,lagoons and backwaters some states of india have indented coastline and thus a number of lagoons and lakes have formed
2675,"due to brackish water-bodies, these water resources are used for fishing and irrigating certain varieties of paddy crops, coconut, etc"
2676,"water demand and utilisation agriculture, being an important part of indian economy, alone uses about 89% of surface water and 92% of groundwater"
2677,"most of the developmental projects, river valley projects like the bhakra-nangal, hirakund, damodar valley, nagaijuna sagar, indira gandhi canal project, etc as well as five year plans were started to provide water to agricultural sector and increase agricultural production"
2678,"besides this, utilisation of surface and groundwater for domestic purposes are 90% and 3% and for industrial sector are 2% and 5%, respectively"
2679,demand of water for irrigation need for irrigation is very high in india due to the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall
2680,as winter and summer season are more or less dry in most parts of india
2681,"some crops like rice, sugarcane, jute and other are water intensive and require more water to grow"
2682,"irrigation helps to grow multiple crops, gives more agricultural productivity, and along with hyv seeds gives more yield at fast rate"
2683,punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh which have more than 85% of net source area under irrigation
2684,total net irrigated area in punjab under wells and tube wells is 76.1% where as it is 51.3% in haryana
2685,"these states utilise a large share of their groundwater resources and thus, it is the major cause behind the depletion of these resources"
2686,"besides these in rajasthan and bihar, the concentration of flouride in groundwater is also increasing due to over withdrawal of this resource"
2687,"whereas in west bengal and bihar, the concentration of arsenic has been increased because of the same reason"
2688,"emerging water problems rapid growth in population and pollution from various sources like industries, agriculture, and domestic sources are the major problems which are responsible for declining the availability of potable water"
2689,the per capita availability of water in india is also decreasing day by day
2690,deterioration of water quality water quality means water free from unwanted foreign substances that make water polluted i.e
2691,"these toxic substances are responsible for water pollution by dissolving or he suspended in lakes, streams, rivers and oceans"
2692,water conservation and management the conservation and management of water become necessary after decreasing the availability of fresh water and increasing its demand by increasing population
2693,"for sustainable development and maintaining the quality of life the government should encourage people to adopt watershed development, rainwater harvesting, recycling and reuse of water, conjunctive use of water for availability of quality water for long time"
2694,prevention of water pollution availability of water resources are shrinking with a faster rate
2695,"it is seen that hilly areas have less dense population and thus, have high quality of water in their rivers"
2696,"whereas plains have dense population and thus have low quality of water in their rivers, and here water is widely used for irrigation, domestic works and industrial works"
2697,plains also contribute more in polluting water sources by draining agricultural wastes (chemical fertilisers and insecticides) solid and domestic wastes and industrial wastes
2698,"during summer, concentration of pollutants in rivers remains high because of low amount of water which unable to flow these pollutants"
2699,"water quality of national aquatic resources at 507 stations have been monitored by the central pollution control board (cpcb), with the collaboration of state pollution control boards"
2700,the analysis of data recorded from these stations shows that the major rivers of india are most polluted by the organic and bacterial pollution
2701,yamuna river is most polluted river in the country between delhi and etawah
2702,"other severely polluted rivers are the sabarmati at allahabad, the gomti at lucknow, the kali, the adyar, the cooum (at entire stretches), the vaigai at madurai, musi at hyderabad and the ganga at kanpur and varanasi"
2703,"ground water is also polluted because of high concentration of heavy toxic metals, flouride nitrates at different parts of the country"
2704,"legislative provisions and laws to prevent river pollution government has taken various steps to minimise river and water pollution but due to some obstacles, these were proved to be less effective, for e.g"
2705,"water (prevention and control of pollution) act of 1974, and environment protection act of 1986 were unsuccessful as in 1997, 251 polluting factories were established along the rivers and lakes"
2706,"the water cess act of 1977 which was made to prevent pollution, was also less effective"
2707,so there is an urgent need to create awareness in public about the importance of water in life
2708,it will result in reducing the pollutants from agricultural activities and industrial discharge
2709,recycle and reuse of water recycle and reuse is a simple and best way to conserve fresh water and make it available for all
2710,"industries can use water of low quality and their waste water for cooling and fire fighting, which can decrease the cost of water for them and conserve fresh water"
2711,"water could be collected after bathing and washing utensils, washing clothes and cars can be a better option for gardening"
2712,"today, reusing and recycling of water is limited to few people but there is enormous scope for replenishing water through recycling"
2713,watershed management watershed management basically refers to efficient management and conservation of surface water
2714,"storage and recharge of ground-water by different methods such as percolation tanks, recharge wells, etc"
2715,"the conservation, regeneration and judicious use of all natural resources (land, water, plants and animals) and human resources"
2716,create a balance among natural elements as well as in society
2717,community participation is a key to success of a watershed development programme
2718,there are various watershed development and management programmes started by both central and state government at national and state level in india like: haryali it is sponsered by the central government while gram panchayats of different villages execute it with the public participation
2719,"this programme enabled people to conserve water for various uses such as drinking,, irrigation, fisheries and afforestation"
2720,"neeru-meeru (water and you) programme in andhra pradesh and arvary pani sansad (in alwar, rajasthan)are examples of state initiated watershed development programmes"
2721,"under these two programmes numerous percolation tanks, dug out ponds (johad), check dams, etc were constructed for harvesting water with the help of public participation"
2722,tamil nadu is only state which has made the construction of water harvesting structures compulsory in the houses
2723,the construction of a building without the structure of water harvesting is not allowed
2724,"despite having such programmes, still most of the people in india are not aware with the benefits of watershed development and managment of water"
2725,"thus, there is a need to encourage more people to participate in this programme"
2726,"rain water harvesting rain water harvesting is a cheap and environmental friendly technique that guides us to store rainwater into bore wells, pits and also recharge groundwater aquifers for different uses"
2727,there are various benefits of rainwater harvesting which are as follows: it increases.water availability
2728,it improves the quality of groundwater by dilution of pollutions like fluoride and nitrates
2729,"it can be used to arrest salt water intrusion in coastal areas, if used to recharge aquifers"
2730,"in traditional rain water harvesting techniques, water is usually collected in any surface water body i.e"
2731,another technique is kund or tanka which is a covered storage under ground tank
2732,rain water harvesting structure can be made on the open spaces and even on the roof tops of the houses and the collected water can be used for domestic use by large number of people and reduce their dependence on ground water
2733,"other methods to solve the problem of water scarcity, we can use brackish water of arid, semi-arid and coastal areas after the desalinised processes"
2734,"by interlinking of rivers, water can be transferred from the water surplus areas to water deficit areas"
2735,"highlights of india’s national water policy, 2002 the national water policy, 2002 stipulates water allocations priorities broadly in the following order i.e"
2736,"the main objectives of this policy are to provide water to all human beings and animals, regular monitoring of surface and ground water quality, create awareness of water as a scarce resource, create conservation consciousness among people through education, regulation, incentives and disincentives, etc"
2737,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 16 water resources will help you
2738,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 16 water resources, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2739,"state with high population uttar pradesh (highest population), maharashtra, bihar, west bengal, madhya pradesh, tamil nadu, rajasthan, karnataka, gujarat and andhra pradesh"
2740,"states with moderate population assam, haryana, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, kerala, punjab, goa"
2741,"states with low population hilly and tribal areas like jammu and kashmir, uttarakhand, himachal pradesh, all north-eastern state (except assam) and union territories excluding delhi"
2742,density of population population density means number of person living in per unit area
2743,"according to 2011 census, in india 382 person live in per sq km of area"
2744,"over the last 50 years the population density has recorded an increase of about 260 persons per sq km, as ranging from 117 persons/sq km in 1951 to 382 persons/sq km in 2011"
2745,spatial pattern of population density in india spatial pattern of population density is also uneven in india
2746,"for example: states/uts having high density of population states bihar (1106 highest), west bengal (1028), kerala (860), uttar pradesh (829), uts delhi (11320 highest), chandigrah (9258)"
2747,"states/uts having moderate density of population haryana (573), tamil nadu (555), punjab (551), jharkhand (414), assam (398), goa (394), maharashtra (365) tripura (350)"
2748,"states/uts having low density of population states arunachal pradesh (17 lowest), mizoram (52), jammu and kashmir (56), sikkim (86), nagaland (119)"
2749,growth of population growth of population refers to the changes occuring in the number of persons living in a particular area between two points of time
2750,two components in population growth afe as follows: natural growth it means the change occuring by the births and deaths in any area
2751,induced growth it means the changes occurred by the volume of inward and outward movement in an area
2752,phases of population growth there are four different phases of population growth: phase-i (1901-1921) it is stagnant or stationary phase because of very low growth rate
2753,phase-iii (1951-1981) this period is known as the period of population explosion in india
2754,rapid fall in death rate and high fertility rate were the main causes of this explosion
2755,phase-iv (post 1981 till present) growth rate has started down gradually because of downward trend in birth rate
2756,"but in developing countries like india, growth rate is still high"
2757,"according to world development report by 2025, indian population will surpass the figure of 1350 million"
2758,regional variation in population growth the spatial pattern of population growth in india is very uneven
2759,it ranges from -0.58% (negative) in nagaland to 55.88% in dadra and nagar haveli
2760,"states/uts having high growth rate of population states meghalaya (27.95%), arunachal pradesh (26.03%), bihar (25.42%), manipur (24.50%), jammu and kashmir (23.64%)"
2761,"uts dadra and nagar haveli (55.88%), daman and diu (53.76%), puducherry (28.08%)"
2762,"states/uts having moderate growth rate of population chhattisgarh (22.61%), jharkhand (22.42%), rajasthan (21.31%), madhya pradesh (20.35%), uttar pradesh (20.23%)"
2763,"states/uts having low growth rate of population states nagaland (-0.58% lowest), kerala (4.91%), goa (8.23%), andhra pradesh (10.98%)"
2764,growth of adolescent population the united nation considers person aged 10-19 year as adolescents population

2788,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 11 population: distribution, density, growth and composition, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2789,sub-urbanisation it is a new trend of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city in search of better quality of life
2790,"census of india, 1991 it defines urban settlements as places which have municipal corporation, cantonment board, notified town area committee and have a population of 5000 persons and above and where 75% of male workers are engaged in non-agricultural activities and density of population is at least 400 persons per sq km"
2791,"types and patterns of settlements settlements can be classified into compact and dispersed by their shape, pattern and types"
2792,"the major types classified by shape are as follows: compact or nucleated settlements in these settlements, large number of houses are built very close to each other and they develop along the river valleys and in fertile plains"
2793,there are close knit communities and people here share common occupations
2794,"dispersed settlements in these settlements, houses are spaced far apart and often interspersed with fields such as a place of worship, a market that binds the settlement together"
2795,rural settlements these settlements are closely and directly related to land
2796,"they are dominated by primary activities like agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry, etc"
2797,"the factors affecting the location of settlements are as follows: water supply rural settlements are located near water bodies such as rivers, lakes and springs as water is needed for irrigation, fishing, navigation and drinking"
2798,"land fertile lands suitable for agriculture are places of human settlement like villages in rolling countryside in europe avoiding swampy areas, low lying river valleys and coastal plains suited for wet rice cultivation in south-east asia"
2799,"upland dry points like uplands, terraces, leaves that are not prone to flooding are places of settlements"
2800,"in tropical countries, people build their houses on stilts near marshy lands to protect themselves from flood, insects and animal pests"
2801,"building material settlements are made in those places where building materials are available like cave dwellings in china, mud bricks houses in african savanna and igloos with ice blocks in polar regions"
2802,"defence places that form good defensive site are developed as settlements like defensive hills, islands, etc"
2803,"planned settlements planned settlements are constructed by government by providing shelter, water and other infrastructure on acquired lands, e.g"
2804,rural settlement patterns this refers to the way the houses are sited in relation to each other
2805,"they are classified as below: on the basis of setting, the main types are plain and size of village, plain villages, plateau villages, coastal villages, forest villages, desert villages, etc"
2806,"on the basis of functions, there may be farming villages, fishermen villages, lumbeijack villages, pastoral villages, etc"
2807,"on the basis of forms/shapes of the settlement, the villages are developed in geometrical forms and shapes such as: linear pattern the houses are located along the road, railway line, river, canal edge of a valley, along a levee"
2808,rectangular pattern the settlements are located in plain areas or in wide inter montane valleys
2809,the roads are rectangular and cut each other at right angles
2810,"circular pattern the settlements develop around lakes, tanks and the central part remains open for keeping the animals to protect them from wild animals"
2811,star-like pattern these settlements develop where several roads converge and the houses are built along the roads
2812,"t-shaped, y-shaped, cross-shaped or cruciform settlements the t-shape settlements develop at tri-junctions, y-shaped settlements emerge where two roads converge on the third and houses are built along these roads, cruciform settlements develop on the cross-roads and houses extend in all the four directions"
2813,double village these settlements extend on both sides of a river where there is a bridge or a ferry
2814,problems of rural settlements rural settlements in developing countries are large in number and have poor infrastructure
2815,"water borne diseases like cholera, jaundice, etc are a common problem"
2816,"there is lack of irrigation facilities, problem of drought and flood in rural settlements"
2817,"inadequate sanitation facility, toilet and garbage disposal facilities cause health related problems"
2818,urban settlements there had been a rapid growth of urban settlements around the world
2819,the first city to reach a population of one million was london in ad 1810
2820,classification of urban settlements common basis of classification are: population size it refers to the lower limit of the population for a settlement to be designated as urban
2821,"in columbia, a settlement having population of 1500 is termed as urban, in argentina and portugal it is 2000, 2500 in usa and thailand, 5000 in india, 30,000 in japan, 250 in denmark, sweden and finland, 300 in iceland, and 1000 in canada and venezuela"
2822,"occupational structure in some countries, the major economic activities alongwith population size designate a settlement as urban"
2823,"in italy, settlement called as urban if more than 50% of its economically productive population is engaged in non-agricultural pursuits"
2824,administration administration set up also designates a settlement as urban in some countries
2825,"in india, if an area has a municipality, notified area council, then it is considered urban"
2826,"location location of urban centres is examined with reference to their function, e.g"
2827,"strategic towns offering natural defence, mining towns, industrial towns, tourist centres, places with historical relics and other places that can provide proper living conditions have the potential to develop into urban centres"
2828,"functions of urban centres on the basis of the functions, the urban settlements are classified into the following: administrative towns national capitals having administrative offices like new delhi, canberra, london, beijing, etc are called administrative towns"
2829,"trading and commercial towns agricultural market towns like winnipeg, banking and financial centres like frankfurt, large inland centres like manchester, transport nodes like lahore, baghdad, agra are important trading centres"
2830,"cultural towns pilgrimage places like jerusalem, varanasi, jagannath puri, etc are considered cultural towns"
2831,"other centres like health and recereation (miami), industrial (pittsburgh and jamshedpur), mining, quarrying (dhanbad) and transport (singapore and mughal sarai) are also urban settlements"
2832,"classification of towns on the basis of forms urban settlements can be linear, square, star or crescent shaped"
2833,cities in developed countries are planned while in developing countries have evolved historically with irregular shapes
2834,chandigarh and canberra are planned cities while smaller town in india have evolved historically from walled cities to large urban sprawls
2835,"addis ababa established in 1878, it is capital of ethiopia and is located in hill valley topography"
2836,"it is a large nodal centre, has large markets and government headquarters"
2837,the city has witnessed rapid growth and expansion in all directions
2838,"it is a garden city with wide open spaces, parks and gardens"
2839,"initially, it was built to accommodate 25,000 people but now it has expanded to accommodate many satellite towns"
2840,"types of urban settlements problems of urban settlements depending upon the size and services available, urban centres are classified further as follows: towns these can be well understood with reference to ‘village’"
2841,"specific functions such as manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, and professional services exist in towns"
2842,"city they are larger than towns, have greater number of economic functions, tend to have transport terminals, major financial institution and administrative offices"
2843,"in the words of lewis mumford, ”the city is in fact the physical form of the highest and most complex type of associative life”"
2844,conurbation the term conurbation was coined by patrick geddes in 1915
2845,this is applied to a large area of urban development that resulted from the merging of originally separate towns or cities like greater london and tokyo
2846,"megalopolis popularised by jean gottman (1957), this signifies super metropolitan region extending as union of conurbations, e.g"
2847,"million city it refers to a city whose population reaches more than one million, e.g"
2848,london reached million mark in 1800 followed by paris in 1850 and by 1950 there were around 80 such cities
2849,distribution of mega cities the number of mega cities or megalopolis has been rising rapidly
2850,"at present, the number of million cities in europe is 58, 206 in asia, 79 in north and central america, 43 in south america, 46 in africa and 6 in australia"
2851,"they are also inadequate in infrastructure such as electricity sewage, disposal, health and education facilities"
2852,"problems of urban settelments in developing countries, urban settlements suffer from unsustainable concentration of population, congested housing, lack of drinking water, poor infrastructure, no proper sewage disposal, health and education facilities, vertical expansion and growth of slums"
2853,most of the cities in developing countries suffer from such unplanned growth
2854,they are: economic problems the decreasing employment opportunities in rural areas push the unskilled and semi-skilled labour force to migrate to urban areas which is already saturated
2855,‘ socio-cultaral problems cities in developing countries suffer from several social ills
2856,lack of employment and education tends to aggravate the crime rates
2857,male selective migration to the urban areas disorts the sex ratio in these cities
2858,"environmental problems urban settlements in developing countries suffer from improper sewage system, massive use of fuel that causes air pollution, lack of clean drinking water, dumping of untreated wastes and huge concrete structures that aggravate the environmental problems"
2859,"healthy city the world health organisation suggests that a healthy city should have clean and safe environment, meet the basic needs of all his inhabitants, involve the community in local government and provide easily accessible health service"
2860,"urban strategy the united nations development programme (undp) outlines the urban strategy that aims to increase shelter for urban poor, provision of basic services like primary healthcare, drinking water, education, sanitation, government facilities, upgrading energy use, alternative transport system and reducing air pollution"

2862,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 10 human settlements, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2863,"culturable wastelands current fallow net sown area land use changes in india unlike other natural resources, land is fixed, it does not change by size or area"
2864,the three main economic changes that changes the land use are: the size of the economy
2865,during the period of 1960-61 to 2008-09 some land use changes are worth mentioning which show an increase and decrease in these categories: area records increase in land use area under forest
2866,on the basis of ownership land can be classified into two categories: private land owned by individual or group of individuals
2867,common property resources (cprs) available for all and can be used by any person
2868,it provides fodder for the livestock and fuel for the households
2869,"in rural areas, such land is of particular relevance for livelihood of the landless and marginal farmers"
2870,"agricultural land use in india most of the indians are dependent on agriculture, directly or indirectly for their subsistence"
2871,the more the land is fertile the more it gives output/production
2872,ownership of land resource is considered as a social status in rural areas
2873,"it is also seen as security for credit, natural hazards or life contingencies"
2874,"availability of total resources for agricultural uses is calculated by adding up net sown area, all fallow lands and culturable wastelands"
2875,cropping intensity (cl)’is calculated as follows: cropping intensity in percentage = gca (gross cropped area)/nsa (net sown area) x 100 cropping seasons in india types of farming in india farming is classified on the basis of moisture available for crops: irrigated farming the main source of moisture for this farming is irrigation by various methods i.e
2876,rainfed farming (barani) the main source of moisture for this farming is rainfall
2877,dryland farming is largely confined to the regions having rainfall less than 75 cm
2878,"these regions grows hardy and drought resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram and gaur"
2879,"on the other hand in wetland farming, the rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement of plants during rainy season"
2880,"these areas grow various water intensive crops such as rice, jute and sugercane"
2881,cropping pattern food grains foodgrains are important for agriculture economy which constitute about two-third of total cropped area in the country
2882,the foodgrains are classified on the basis of structure of grains: cereals india ranks 3rd in the production of cereals after china and usa
2883,india produces 11% of the world and covers about 54% of the total cropped area in india
2884,these cereals are: rice it is the most important food crop of india which feeds more than half of our population
2885,india ranked second with the production nearly 22% after china in the world
2886,"states like west bengal, punjab and uttar pradesh were major rice producing states in india"
2887,"himalyas regions, it is grown as a kharif crop, whereas in west bengal, farmers grow three crops of rice called ‘aus’, ‘aman’ and ‘boro’"
2888,wheat india share 12% of total wheat production of the world
2889,it is cultivated on about 14% of the total cropped area
2890,"about 85% of this area comes under the indo-gangetic plain, malwa plateau and himalayas in north and central parts of the country"
2891,"the major wheat producing states of india are uttar pradesh, punjab, haryana, rajasthan, and madhya pradesh, bihar and jammu and kashmir"
2892,coarse grains these crops are grown in almost 16.50% of total cropped area in the country
2893,these coarse grains are: jowar/sorghum it is grown in about 5.3% of total cropped area
2894,the major producer of jowar are central and southern states i.e
2895,bajra it is grown in about 5.2% of the total cropped area in the country
2896,"the major producers of bajra are maharashtra, gujarat, uttar pradesh, rajasthan and haryana"
2897,maize it is grown in about 3.6% of total cropped area in the country
2898,it is sown all over india except eastern and north eastern regions
2899,"the leading producers are madhya pradesh, andhra pradesh, telangana, karnataka, rajasthan and uttar pradesh"
2900,pulses pulses are grown in india on about 11% of the total cropped area
2901,"india is one of the largest producers of pulses, as it cultivates about 20% pulses of the world"
2902,these are largely confined to the drylands of deccan and central plateaus and north-western parts of the country
2903,gram it is grown in 2.8% of the total cropped area
2904,"the major producers are madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, maharashtra, andhra pradesh and rajasthan"
2905,tur (arhar) this is grown in 2% of the total cropped area of india
2906,maharashtra is the leading producer of tur which produces about 75% of tur in india
2907,"oil seeds include groundnut, (3.6%), rapeseed and mustard (2.5%), soybean, sunflower, etc"
2908,these different oilseeds are grown in india about 14% of total cropped area in the country
2909,"drylands of malwa plateau, maharashtra, gujarat, rajasthan, telangana and rayalseema of andhra pradesh and karnataka plateau are leading producers of oilseeds"
2910,soybean and sunflower are other important oil seeds grown in india
2911,fibre crops fibre crops are one which provides fibre for preparing cloth
2912,these includes: cotton india grows both short staple (indian) cotton as well as long staple (american) cotton
2913,"this makes india the fourth largest producer of cotton after china, usa and pakistan"
2914,"largest producers of cotton in india are maharashtra, gujarat, andhra pradesh, punjab and haryana"
2915,jute india accounts for about 60% of the world’s jute production
2916,west bengal (75%) is the largest producer of jute in the country
2917,other crops sugarcane it is an important cash crop in india
2918,"india’s sugarcane production is about 23% of the world’s total production, which makes india the 2nd largest producer after brazil"
2919,uttar pradesh accounts 40 percent of sugarcane production and secures a position of the largest producer of india
2920,tea assam (53.2%) is the largest producer of tea in india
2921,coffee india is the 7th largest producer of coffee in the world which accounts about 3.2% share
2922,karnataka is the largest producer of coffee that produces more than 66% of india’s total coffee
2923,agricultural development in india about 54.6% of population is engaged in agricultural activity
2924,according to census (2011) and about 57% of its land is used for cultivation of various crops in india whereas world average is only about 12%
2925,"the land-human ratio in india is only 0.31 hectare whereas, the world is almost double of this figure i.e"
2926,"strategy of development before independence, indian agriculture was largely subsistence in nature, this period was frequently  witnessed severe droughts, famines and food shortage"
2927,"consequently, government took several steps to increase the production of food grains"
2928,following three strategies were adopted to achieve this goal: switching over from cash crops to food crops
2929,increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable and fallow land under plough
2930,"however, indian agriculture could not progress much, then government introduced modem technology into agriculture"
2931,these were: high yielding variety (hyv) of seeds fertilisers mechanisation improved irrigation and credit marketing facilities
2932,intensive area development programme all the above inputs were the main components of what is known as green revolution
2933,this strategy of agricultural development in the country made the country self-reliant in foodgrain production
2934,this led to regional disparities in agricultural development in the country till the seventies
2935,"consequently, planning commission prepared plans to solve the problems of agriculture in rainfed areas in 1980s"
2936,"growth of agricultural output and technology since independence, there has been improvement in technologies used for agricultural production"
2937,"india is now became 1st largest producer of pulses and jute and 2nd largest in rice, wheat, groundnut, sugarcane and vegetables"
2938,"new technologies also came up to increase the production of food grains, for e.g"
2939,problems of indian agriculture these problems are: dependence on erratic monsoon there is only 33% cultivated area is under irrigation
2940,the nature of south-west monsoon is very fluctuating which causes flood and drought situation in india
2941,low productivity india also lag behind in terms of per hectare production and per person production and also behind at international level
2942,this low productivity is a result of high population which creates a heavy pressure on available land resources
2943,constraints of financial resources and indebtedness lack of money and financial resources are the major constraints to the development of agriculture in india
2944,"as majority of farmers are small, marginal and poor, they cannot afford highly expensive inputs to increase their production"
2945,lack of land reforms lack of land reforms and unequal distribution of land resources led to the worst condition of poor and marginal farmers and also become constraint in the development of agriculture in india
2946,small farm size and fragmentation of landholdings ‘inheritance law’ is mainly responsible for small and fragmented farm size
2947,"lack of commercialisation as most of the farmers are poor and marginal, farmers practice subsistence agriculture for their living"
2948,degradation of cultivable land after green revolution degradation has started in india
2949,"excessive use of irrigation, chemical fertilizers, etc created problems of water lodging and solemnization"
2950,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 15 land resources and agriculture will help you
2951,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 15 land resources and agriculture, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
2952,social capabilities due to displacement and weakening social ties environmental capabilities due to increasing in pollution
2953,"thus, in turn, this has adverse effects on their quality of life and human development"
2954,"human development after seeing the inability of the western or euro-centric view of development to handle the existing issues, the concept of human development is brought against this concept"
2955,it is considered as a solution to all the existing problems
2956,"thus, human development is a process of widening and providing more choices to people, providing them more opportunities for education, health care, empowerment, income and covering all the choices from a healthy physical environment to economic, social and political freedom"
2957,the first systematic effort in enhancing the human development was made by united nations development programme (undp) by publishing the first human development report in 1990
2958,undp is responsible for making and amending the indicators to decide the human development of a country
2959,"it gives ranks to all member countries, on the basis of calculated scores by using indicators and publish them in the report"
2960,"human development in india according to human development report (hdr) of 2011, india ranks 134th with the composite hdi value of 0.547 (medium human development) among 172 member countries of the world"
2961,there are many socio-cultural and historical factors which are responsible for the low score condition of human development in india
2962,"socio-cultural factors these include violation of human rights, social discriminations like race, religion, gender and caste based discriminations, social problems of crimes, terrorism and war"
2963,"political factors these include political stability and nature of state, forms of government, level of empowerment, etc"
2964,planning commission of india also prepares the human development report (hdr) for india and takes the states and union territories as units for analysis
2965,"planning commission in its human development report takes the given indicators selected by undp along with other indicators like economic attainment, social empowerment, social distributive justice, accessibility of opportunities, hygiene and welfare policies made by the states"
2966,"indicators of economic attainment economic productivity forms an integral part of human development, thus"
2967,gross national product (gnp) and per capita availability are taken as measures to assess the resources base/endowment of any country
2968,on one side india’s gdp at current prices (₹ 3200 thousand crores ) and its per capita income (₹ 20813) are showing an impressive development in india in terms of resource base
2969,"but on the other side, the existence of poverty deprivation, malnutrition, illiteracy and different prejudices like caste, religion and gender discrimination are showing a different face of economic achievements"
2970,variation in per capita income the spatial pattern of per capita income is uneven
2971,"states having high per capita income (more than ₹ 4000 per year at 1980-81 prices) maharashtra, punjab, haryana, gujarat and delhi"
2972,"states having low per capita income ( less than ₹ 2000 per year) uttar pradesh, bihar, odisha, madhya pradesh, assam, jammu and kashmir, etc"
2973,variation in per capita consumption there are large regional disparities in terms of per capita consumption
2974,"developed states having high per capita consumption (more than ₹ 690 per month) are kerala, punjab, haryana, maharashtra, gujarat, etc"
2975,"poor states having low per capita consumption (less than ₹ 520 per month) are uttar pradesh, bihar, odisha and madhya pradesh, etc"
2976,"these variations in both per capita income and consumption are showing some serious problems like poverty, unemployment and under-employment"
2977,"in absolute terms, it reflects the inability of an individual to satisfy certain basic needs for a sustained healthy and reasonably productive living"
2978,"bihar and odisha (population living below poverty line) recorded more than 40% poverty, while madhya pradesh, sikkim, assam, tripura, arunachal pradesh, meghalaya and nagaland recorded more than 30% of poverty"
2979,"union territories record poverty less than 30% are chandigarh, daman and diu and delhi"
2980,jobless growth and rampant unemployment are some of the major causes responsible for poverty in india
2981,"indicators of healthy life healthy and long life is important for everyone and it is measured by availability of adequate health facilities to decrease infant deaths, post delivery deaths of mothers, old age health care, proper nutrition and safety of people"
2982,the health indicators are: mortality rate india has been successful in declining mortality rate from 25.1 per thousand in 1951 to 8.1 per thousand in 1999
2983,infant mortality rate is also declined from 148 per thousand in 1951 to 70 per thousand in 1999
2984,"average life expectancy rate it is increased from 37.1 years to 62.3 years for males, 36.2 to 65.3 for females during 1951-1999"
2985,birth rate india has also brought down its birth rate from 40.8 in 1951 to 26.1 in 1999
2986,"according to 2001 census, the findings are very disturbing particularly in case of child sex ratio between 0-6 age group"
2987,"except kerala (highest sex-ratio), all the states have the declining trend in child-sex ratio"
2988,"for example, haryana and punjab have the child sex ratio below 800 female children on per thousand male children (according to 2011 census, child sex ratio decline against 2001 from 927 to 919)"
2989,"indicators of social empowerment freedom from hunger, poverty servitude, bondage, ignorance, illiteracy and other forms of domination is the key to human development"
2990,"empowerment and participation of the people by using their capabilities and choices in the society, leads to actual freedom"
2991,people can use their capabilities and choices by understanding the society and environment
2992,this can happen through literacy as it opens the door of a world of knowledge and freedom
2993,"literacy in india according to 2001 census, india’s literacy is about 65.4%, while its female literacy is 54.16% (according to 2011, 74.04% is total literacy rate, of these 82.14% and 65.46% are males and females respectively)"
2994,percentage of total literacy and female literacy are higher than the national average in most of the southern states
2995,literacy rate is low in bihar (47.53%) and high in kerala (90.92%)
2996,it shows a large regional disparities in context of literacy in india
2997,"literacy rate is low in rural areas, in some marginalised sections of our society like females, schedule castes, schedule tribes, agricultural labourers, etc"
2998,"inspite of having some improved condition in literacy rate in these section, there is still a wide gap between the rich and the marginalised sections"
2999,human development index in india human development report in india is prepared annually by the institute of applied manpower research in the supervision of planning commission by taking states and union territories as the unit of study
3000,states with high hdi value are kerala (highest hdi among indian states i.e
3001,"0.92), delhi, himachal pradesh, goa and punjab, whereas chhattisgarh, odisha and bihar (lowest hdi among indian states with 0.41) recorded as lowest hdi value"
3002,"reasons for high and low hdi value there are several reasons for having high and low hdi value include socio-political, economic or historical reasons"
3003,higher number of literates is the main reason for kerala having high hdi value
3004,"on the other hand, bihar, odisha, madhya pradesh, assam and uttar pradesh have low composite value of hdi because of their lowest literacy rate"
3005,"economically developed states like maharastatra, tamil nadu, and punjab have higher value of hdi as compared to states like chhattisgarh, bihar, madhya pradesh"
3006,"historical reasons are also responsible for having high or low human development, e.g"
3007,"regional imbalances and social disparities which emerged under the british period are still crucial in determining the level of development because they are still affecting the political, economical and social system in india"
3008,"despite of having planned development by the government, the most important goals are still far away from the ideal level"
3009,"population, environment and development development is important because it improves quality of life, but simultaneously brought many problems like regional disparities, social inequalities, discriminations, deprivations, displacement of people, violation of human rights and declining human values and environmental degradation"
3010,undp in its human development report of 1993 tried to amend these issues and found an important role of civil societies in bringing about peace and human development
3011,"these civil societies can help by building up opinion for reduction in military expenditure, demobilisation of armed forces, transition from defense to production of basic goods and services and reduction in the nuclear weapons in developed countries"
3012,"the view of these approaches are presented by neomalthusians, environmentalists and radical ecologists"
3013,these thinkers argued to maintain a balance between population and resources before starting any developmental activity
3014,sir robert malthus was the first scholar who drew the attention towards the imbalance between population and resources
3015,"along with the problem of the scarcity of resources and growing population, there was another problem of unevenly distributed resources over the space and their accessibility only by few rich countries and people"
3016,so there were conflicts between rich and poor countries for these unevenly distributed resources
3017,"along with malthus, mahatama gandhi was also a supporter of balance and harmony between population and resources"
3018,"according to him, industrialisation has institutionalised the loss of morality, spirituality, self-reliance, non-violence and mutual co-operation and environment"
3019,"further, gandhiji says that, higher goals in the life of a person or by a nation can be achieved through the austerity for individual, trusteeship of social wealth and non-violence"

3021,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 13 human development, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
3022,nh referred to roads which are constructed and maintained by central government
3023,national highways are meant for inter-state transport and movement of defence men and material in strategic areas
3024,"in 2008-09, total length of national highways was 70934 km which was 19700 km in 1951"
3025,"these highways connect the state capitals, major cities, important ports, railways junctions, etc and carry’ about 40% of the road traffic despite they constitute only 1.67% of total road length"
3026,"the national highways authority of india (nhai – 1^95) is an autonomous body, under the ministry of surface transport which is entrusted with the responsibility of development, maintenance, operation and for the improvement of the quality of national highways"
3027,"national highways development projects golden quadrilateral it is 5846 km long 4/6 lane, high density corridor"
3028,it was meant to connect india’s four big metro cities of delhi-mumbai- chennai-kolkata
3029,it will deduct the time-distance and cost of movement among the mega cities of india
3030,its construction help ip reducing the time distance and cost of movement among mega cities considerably
3031,north-south and east-west corridors the north-south corridor is a 4076 km long highway which is meant to connect srinagar in jammu and kashmir with kanyakumari in tamil nadu including kochchi-salem spur
3032,the east-west corridor is 3640 km long road which aims to connect silchar in assam with the port town of porbandar in gujarat
3033,state highways these roads are connected to the national highways and join the state capitals with district headquarters and other important towns
3034,district roads these roads connect district headquarters and other important nodes in the district
3035,they account for 60.83% of the total road length of the country
3036,about 33.86% of the total road length in india are categorised as rural roads
3037,other roads these include border roads and international highways: border roads these are strategically important roads along the northern and north-eastern boundary of the country
3038,border road organisation (bro) is responsible for construction and maintenance of these roads
3039,it was established in may 1960 with the aim to accelerate economic development and strengthening defence preparedness through rapid and coordinated improvement of strategically important border roads
3040,bro’s major achievement is construction of roads in high altitude mountainous terrain joining chandigarh with manali (himachal pradesh) and leh (ladakh)
3041,this road is located at the average height of 4270 meters above mean sea level
3042,the total length of border roads was 40450 km in 2005 which was constructed by bro
3043,besides the construction and maintenance of roads in strategically sensitive areas
3044,international highways they are constructed with the aim to promote harmonious relationship with neighbouring countries and provide an effective connection with india
3045,density of roads the distribution of roads is not uniform in the country
3046,density of roads (length of roads per 100 sq km of area) is the method to compare the network of roads of one area to another area
3047,"the density of roads is influenced by nature of terrains, and level of economic development"
3048,as most of the northern states and major southern states have high density of roads (e.g
3049,"uttar pradesh has highest road density of 532.27 km), whereas himalayan region, north-eastern region, madhya pradesh and rajasthan have low density of roads (e.g"
3050,"quality of roads, besides density, is also better in plains as compared to high altitude areas, rainy and forested regions"
3051,rail transport india has one of the longest railway network in the world
3052,"on one hand, it facilitates the movement of freight and passengers and on the other hand, it contributes to the growth of economy"
3053,"mahatama gandhi said, the indian railways, “brought people of diverse cultures together to contribute to india’s freedom struggle” in 1853, the first indian railway was started from bombay to thane covering a distance of 34 km"
3054,"being the largest government undertaking in india, indian railways network is 64460 km long (31th march, 2011)"
3055,"to reduce the pressure of this large size railway from a centralised railway management system, indian railway system has been divided into seventeen zones"
3056,"on the basis of the width of the track of indian railways as follows: broad gauge in broad gauge, the distance between rails is 1.676 metre"
3057,the total length of broad gauge lines is 55188 km in 2011
3058,"metre gauge in metre gauge, the distance between the rails is 1 metre"
3059,the total length of metre gauge is 6809 km in 2011
3060,"narrow gauge in narrow gauge, the distance between the rails is 0.762 metres or 0.610 metres"
3061,the total length of narrow gauge line is 2463 km in 2011
3062,this category of railway lines is mostly found in the hilly areas
3063,indian railways has taken major steps to improve the performance of this means of transport like: to convert the metre and narrow gauges to broad gauge
3064,replacement of steam engine by diesel and electric engines which may help in keeping the environment clean
3065,"development of railways in india was started by the britishers and after the independence, scenario has been changed by extending railway routes to other areas"
3066,konkan railways along the western coast which provide a direct line between mumbai and mangalore was a significant development in this regard
3067,konkan railway is one of the important achievements of indian railways which was constructed in 1998
3068,it is a 760 km long rail route which connects roha in maharashtra to mangalore in karnataka
3069,railway is still the most important means of transport for the masses
3070,"in the hill states, north-eastern states, central part of india and rajasthan, railway network is relatively less dense"
3071,water transport water transport is the cheapest means of transport for carrying heavy and bulky material as well as passenger services
3072,"the water transport is of two types: inland waterways oceanic waterways inland waterways before the introduction of railways, inland waterways was the chief mode of transport"
3073,"but, now it is losing its significance due to: tough competition from road and railway transport"
3074,diversion of river water for irrigation purposes made them non-navigable in large parts of their courses
3075,india has 14500 km of navigable waterways which accounts for about 1% of country’s transportation
3076,"at present 3700 km of major rivers are navigable by mechanised flat bottom vessels, but out of it only 2000 are actually used"
3077,"similiarly, out of 4800 km of the network of navigable canal, only 900 km is navigable by mechanised vessels"
3078,"the inland waterways authority which was setup in 1986 is responsible for the development, maintenance and regulation of national waterways in the country"
3079,"currently, there are three inland waterways which are considered as national waterways by the authority"
3080,description of these waterways are as follows: national waterways of india oceanic routesten other inland waterways have been identified by inland waterways authority
3081,the backwaters (kadal) of kerala has special significance which not only provides transport but also attract tourists here
3082,the famous nehru trophy boat race (vallamkali) is also held in the backwaters
3083,these play an important role in the transport sector of india’s economy
3084,"india’s vast coastline of about 7,517 km (including islands) easily facilitates this type of transport"
3085,there are twelve major and 185 minor ports which provide infrastructural support to these routes
3086,about 95% of india’s foreign trade by volume and 70% by value moves through ocean routes
3087,these routes give international trade service as well as provide transportation between the islands and the rest of the country
3088,air transportation air transport facilitates the fastest movement of goods and passengers from one place to another place
3089,it is good for long distances and areas which have uneven terrain and climatic conditions
3090,"air transport in india was started in 1911 with a short distance, (10 km) airmail operation from allahabad to nairn"
3091,"the airport authority of india is responsible for providing safe, efficient air traffic and aeronautical communication services in the indian air space"
3092,"now it manages 126 airports including 11 international, 86 domestic and 29 civil enclaves at defence air fields"
3093,"there are two corporations, air india and indian airlines which manage air transport in india"
3094,air india it is a corporation of india which provides international air service for both passengers and cargo traffic
3095,it connects all the continents of the world through its services
3096,"indian airlines indian airlines, the largest state owned domestic carrier changed its names to ‘indian by dropping’ word ‘airlines’ in 8th december, 2005"
3097,the new brand name ‘indian’ now appears on both sides of the fuselage
3098,the logo depicting ia which was used to be display on orange tail is now replaced by a new logo
3099,"new logo is apartly visible blue wheel and is inspired by the sun temple at konark (odisha), symbolising timeless motion, convergence and divergence"
3100,it also represents strength as well as trust that has stood the test of time
3101,history of indian airlines 1911-air transport in india was launched between allahabad and naini
3102,"947-air transport was provided by four major companies namely indian national airways, tata sons limited, air services of india and deccan airways"
3103,"1953-air transport was nationalised and two corporations, air india international and indian airlines were formed"
3104,"pawan hans is the major organisation in india which provides helicopter services in hilly areas, for tourism in north-eastern sector and mainly to petroleum sector and tourism"
3105,oil and gas pipelines pipelines are convenient and best means of transporting liquids and gases over long distances
3106,"oil india limited (oil) is responsible for exploration, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas"
3107,its one of the major achievement is the construction of asia’s first cross country pipeline
3108,this pipeline covers a distance of 1157 km from naharkatiya oil field in assam to barauni refinery in bihar
3109,"in 1966, this pipeline was further extended to kanpur, uttar pradesh"
3110,"in western region of india, oil also constructed extensive network of pipelines – ankleshwar-koyali, mumbai high-koyal and hazira-vijaipur-jagdishpur (hvj) pipelines"
3111,"recently, a pipeline is also constructed from salaya (gujarat) to mathura (uttar pradesh)"
3112,it is 1256 km long pipeline which transport crude oil from gujarat to punjab (jalandhar) via mathura
3113,construction of a 660 km long pipeline from numaligarh to siliguri is also in progress
3114,"communication networks a number of communication cum-transportation means have been used since human history, for e.g"
3115,"messages ware delivered by beating drum or hollow tree trunks, giving indication through smoke or fire or with the help of fast runners"
3116,"development in the field of science and technology brought many revolutionary inventions in means of communication like post office, telegraph, printing press, telephone, satellite, etc"
3117,"on the basis of scale and quality, the mode of communication can be divided into following categories: personal communication system the most advanced and best means among all personal communication system is internet which is widely used in urban cities"
3118,e-mail is the main source through which a user can directly connect with others and can also get access to the world of knowledge and information
3119,use of internet is increasing for e-commerce and carrying out money transactions
3120,"the internet is like a huge control warehouse of data, with detailed information on various items"
3121,it is a cheaper mode of communication which provides an efficient access to information at a comparatively low cost
3122,mass communication system radio radio broadcasting was started in 1923 by radio club of bombay
3123,"within short time, it gained immense popularity and became a part of every househod in india"
3124,"after seeing its popularity, the government of india, in 1930 took the control of this mode of communication under indian broadcasting system"
3125,it was changed to all india radio in 1936 and to akashwani in 1957
3126,"it broadcasts various programmes related to information, education, entertainment and special news bulletins on special session of parliament and state legislature"
3127,television (tv) television (tv) broadcasting has emerged as the most effective audio-visual medium for disseminating information and educating masses
3128,"till 1972, it was the only urban place where tv services were available"
3129,"in 1976, tv broadcasting services were separated by all india radio and got a separate identity as doordarshan (dd)"
3130,its revolutionary development began after the launch of insat-ia (national television -d1) when common national programmes (cnp) were started for the entire network and its services were extended to the backward and remote rural areas
3131,"from economic and strategic point of view, use of satellite is very vital for the country as these give continuous and synoptic view larger area"
3132,"weather forcast, monitoring of natural calamities, surveillance of border areas, etc"
3133,there are two satellite system in india on the basis of configuration and purposes: indian national satellite system (insat) this was established in 1983
3134,"it is a multi-purpose satellite system for telecommunication, meteorological observatioon and for various other data and programmes"
3135,indian remote sensing satellite system (irs) the irs satellite system started in india with the launch of irs-ia in march 1988 from vaikanour in russia
3136,india has also developed her indigenous launching vehicle pslv (polar satellite launch vehicle)
3137,these remote sensing satellites collect data in several spectral band and transmit them to ground stations which is very useful in the management of natural resources and other various purposes
3138,the national remote sensing agency (nrsa) at hyderabad is responsible for facilitating for acquisition of data and its processing
3139,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 20 transport and communication will help you
3140,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 20 transport and communication, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
3141,water pollution air pollution noise pollution land pollution water pollution quality of water is majorly degraded by a number of factors i.e
3142,indiscriminate use of water by fast growing population and expansion of industries
3143,"no surface water is found in pure form in rivers, canals, lakes, etc as all the water sources contain small quantities of suspended particles, organic and inorganic substances"
3144,"water becomes polluted, when quantity of these substances increases in it"
3145,it becomes unsuitable for human uses and its self purifying capacity declines
3146,"there are two sources of water pollution: natural erosion, landslides, decay and decomposition of plants and animals, etc are natural sources that make water polluted"
3147,"human industrial, agricultural and cultural activities of human beings make water polluted"
3148,water pollution created from human beings are major problem in modern times
3149,"sources of pollution in the ganga and the yamuna rivers most of the industrial wastes, e.g"
3150,"polluted waste water, poisonous gases, chemical residuals numerous heavy metals, dust, smoke, etc are disposed off in running water, lakes, reservoirs, rivers and other water bodies and thus, destroy the bio-system of these waters"
3151,"major culprits are leather, pulp and paper, textiles and chemicals industries"
3152,"today use of various types of chemicals like inorganic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides are common in agriculture"
3153,"these chemicals pollute surface water such as rivers, lakes, tanks as well as groundwater by infiltrating into the soil"
3154,these fertilizers increase the amount of nitrate content of surface waters
3155,"besides this, cultural activities such as pilgrimage, religious fairs, tourism, etc also cause water pollution"
3156,"in india, almost all surface water sources are contaminated and unfit for human consumption"
3157,"use of polluted water can harm human health and can cause various water borne diseases, e.g"
3158,world health organisation (who) shows that about one-fourth of the communicable diseases in india are water borne
3159,"air pollution a larger proportion of contaminants like dust, fumes, gas, fog, odour, smoke or vapour in air for a long duration is known as air pollution may be harmful to flora and fauna and to property"
3160,"there is an increase in emission of poisonous gases into the atmosphere because of increasing use of various fuels for energy in various sectors, thus resulting in the pollution of air"
3161,"the main sources of air pollution are combustion of fossil fuels, mining and industries which release oxides of sulphur, and nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead and asbestos"
3162,"effects of air pollution the effects of air pollution are as follows: air pollution is responsible for many diseases related to our respiratory, nervous and circulatory systems"
3163,air pollution is responsible for creating smoky fog over cities which is known as urban smog
3164,first rain after summer in urban areas always shows high acidic nature of rain water i.e
3165,noise pollution noise pollution refers to a noise that causes a condition which is unbearable and uncomfortable to human beings
3166,it is a recent phenomenon which became a serious concern only after a variety of technological innovations
3167,the level of steady noise is measured by sound level expressed in terms of decibels (db)
3168,"factories, mechanised construction and demolition works, automobiles and aircrafts are major sources of noise that cause noise pollution"
3169,"apart from these, there are also some periodic sources of noise pollution such as sirens, loudspeakers in different festivals and programmes and other activities of different communities"
3170,noise produced by traffic is a major source of noise pollution
3171,"intensity and nature of noise made by traffic is dependent on various factors such as type of vehicle (aircraft, train vehicle, etc)/ condition of road and condition of vehicle (in case of automobiles)"
3172,"in sea traffic, the noise; pollution is limited to the harbour because of loading and unloading activities of containers"
3173,"noise pollution from industries is also a serious problem but its intensity varies because of some factors such as type of industry, types of machines and tools, etc"
3174,"the intensity of noise pollution decreases as distance from source of pollution (industrial areas, arteries of transportation, airport, etc) increases"
3175,"effects of noise pollution noise pollution is a major cause of anxiety, tension and some other mental problems and disorders among people in many metropolitan and big cities in india"
3176,"urban waste disposal overcrowding, congestion, increasing population, improper infrastructure and facilities to support this population, lack of sanitation, foul air, etc are some features of urban areas"
3177,"mismanagement of solid wastes and environmental pollution caused by them has now become a major problem.solid wastes are a variety of old and used articles,for e.g"
3178,"stained small pieces of metals, broken glass wares, plastic containers, polythene bags,ashes, floppies, cds, etc dumped at different places"
3179,"these discarded materials are also known as refuses, garbage and rubbish,etc and are disposed off from two sources i.e"
3180,public lands or private  contractor’s sites are used to disposed off household or domestic wastes
3181,low lying public grounds (landfill areas) are used to disposed off industrial solid wastes by public (municipal) facilities
3182,"industries, thermal power houses and building constructions and demolitions are contributing with more turn out of ashes and debris in solid wastes"
3183,disposal of industrial wastes has increased because of the concentration of industrial units in and around urban centres
3184,urban waste is a bigger problem in small towns and cities than metropolitan cities in the country
3185,"about 90% of solid waste is collected and disposed off successfully in mumbai, kolkata, chennai, bangalore and other metropolitan cities"
3186,about 30-50% solid wastes in other towns and cities in country is not collected and disposed off properly
3187,"it is a major problem because it accumulates on streets, in open spaces between houses and in wastelands and can cause various health problems"
3188,impacts of improper management of solid wastes improper management of solid wastes has following impacts: solid wastes are threat to human health and can cause various diseases
3189,"it creates foul smell and it harbours flies and rodents that can cause typhoid, diphtheria, diarrhoea, malaria, cholera and other diseases"
3190,solid waste can create inconvenience rapidly if they are not properly handled
3191,wind and rain water can splitted it and cause a discomfort to people
3192,industrial solid waste can cause water pollution by dumping it into water bodies
3193,untreated waste release various poisonous biogases such as methane in air by slow fermentation process
3194,these wastes are resources as energy can be generated from them
3195,"by compositing these wastes, problem of energy could be solved as well as its management in urban areas"
3196,"rural-urban migration movement of people from rural area to urban area are caused by various factors such as high demand for labour in urban areas, low job opportunities in rural areas and disparities in terms of development in rural and urban areas"
3197,smaller and medium cities provide low opportunities which force people to bypass these small cities and directly come to the mega cities for their livelihood
3198,"mostly daily wage workers like, welders; carpenter, etc move to another cities for work, periodically and provide remittances to their families for daily consumption, health care, schooling of children, etc"
3199,this has improved their early abject situation into a better one
3200,"simultaneously, due to temporary and transferable job situation, these labourers and their families hear the pain of separation of their near and dear ones"
3201,sometimes these workers also face difficulty in assimilation to the new culture and environment
3202,"due to these menial jobs at low wages in informal sector in urban areas, the spouses are left behind in rural areas to look after children and elderly people"
3203,"trend of urbanisation in the world currently, about 54% of the world’s 7 billion (2011) population lives in urban areas of world"
3204,"it is estimated that between 2025 to 2030, this percentage would be grown with 1.44% per year"
3205,this high urban population will pressurise governments to optimise infrastructure facilities in urban areas for giving a standard quality of life
3206,"it is estimated that by 2050, about two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas"
3207,"it would create a high pressure on existing infrastructure and sanitation, health, crime problems and urban poverty"
3208,there are various factors responsible for growth of urban population: when high birth rate and low morality rate increase
3209,in india there is a estimation that about 60% india’s urban population has increased after 1961
3210,about 29% of this growth has been caused by rural-urban migration
3211,problems of slums settlement geography differentiate the two concepts namely urban or urban centres and rural
3212,these two are differentiated by their functions but sometimes interdependent on each other
3213,"these two concepts are also divided in terms of their separate cultural, economic and technological aspects"
3214,"according to 2001 census, about 72% of india’s population is rural (according to 2011, rural population is 68.84%)"
3215,most of these rural areas are still in poor conditions and perform primary activities
3216,these work as supplement to the core urban centre forming its hinterland
3217,"urban areas are more developed in terms of the socio-economic, politico-cultural, etc than other areas"
3218,"urban areas have farm house, high income of people and their localities, wide roads, street lights, water and sanitation facilities, lawns, well developed green belts, parks, playgrounds and other facilities, provisions for individual security and right of privacy"
3219,"apart from these attractions urban areas also have slums, jhuggi jhopari’ clusters and colonies of shanty-structures"
3220,these are occupied by the migrants who were forced to migrate from rural areas to urban areas for employment and livelihood
3221,"but because of high rent and high costs of land, they could not afford proper housing and start to live in these areas"
3222,"characteristics of slums slums have following characteristics: slums are least choice residential areas that have broken down house, bad hygienic conditions, poor ventilation and does not have basic facilities like drinking water, light and toilet facilities, etc"
3223,slums are overcrowded with people and have many narrow street patterns prone to serious hazards from fire
3224,"most of the slum dwellers works for low wages, high risk-prone and unorganised sectors of the urban economy"
3225,"they face various health related problems such as malnutrition, illness and prone to various diseases"
3226,they are not able to send their children school to provide them education because of low level of income
3227,"dwellers are vulnerable to drug abuse, alcoholism, crime, vandalism, escapism, apathy and social exclusion because of poverty"
3228,"land degradation the limited availability and deterioration of quality of land, both are responsible to exert pressure on agricultural land.soil erosion, water logging, salinisation and alkalinisation of land lead to land degradation which declines productivity of land"
3229,"in simple words, temporary or permanent decline in productive capacity of the land is known as land degradation"
3230,"but if process of degradation is not checked, then a degraded land may be converted into wasteland"
3231,classification of wastelands national remote sensing agency (nrsa) it is an organisation responsible for classification of wastelands in india
3232,it classifies wastelands by using remote sensing techniques on the basis of the processes that have created them
3233,"wasteland caused by natural agents gullied/ ravinous land, desertic or coastal sand, barren rocky areas, steep sloping land, glacial areas, etc are types of wastelands caused by the natural agents"
3234,"wasteland caused by natural as well as human factors water logged and marshy areas, land affected by salinity and alkalinity and land with and without scrubs which are degraded by the natural as well as human factors are included in this category"
3235,"wastelands caused by man-made processes shifting cultivation area, degraded land under plantation crops, degraded forests, degraded pastures and mining and industrial wastelands are some types of wastelands that are degraded because of human action"
3236,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 22 geographical perspective on selected issues and problems will help you
3237,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 22 geographical perspective on selected issues and problems, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
3238,ferrous minerals these are rich in iron contents and an important source of iron
3239,non-ferrous minerals these do not have iron content and have highest proportion of other metals
3240,they are classified into two groups: organic minerals these are made up of organic matter of buried animal and plants
3241,characteristics of minerals resources the main characteristics of minerals are as follows:  their distribution over the earth surface are uneven
3242,there is inverse relationship in quantity and quality of minerals i.e
3243,good quality minerals are less in quantity as compared to low quality minerals

3344,"bio-energy bio-energy refers to energy derived from biological products which includes agricultural residues, municipal, industrial and other wastes"
3345,"it can be converted into electricity or electrical energy, heat energy or gas for cooking food"
3346,this can also solve the problem of garbage and waste in urban areas because energy can also be derived from these
3347,"it can contribute in improving economic life of rural peoples in developing countries, increasing environmental problems like pollution, solid waste management, enhancing self-reliance and reducing pressure on fuel wood"
3348,a project in okhla (delhi) is an example that generates energy from municipal waste
3349,"conservation of mineral resources there are some methods through which we can conserve mineral resources: adoption of renewable resources in place of exhaustible resources like solar power, wind, geothermal energy can save our non-renewable resources"
3350,use of substitutes for scarce metals may also reduce their consumption
3351,"export of strategic and scarce minerals must be reduced, so that the existing reserve may be used for a longer period"
3352,we hope the given cbse class 12 geography notes chapter 17 mineral and energy resources will help you
3353,"if you have any query regarding ncert geography class 12 notes chapter 17 mineral and energy resources, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
3354,"sectoral planning approach in this approach, the development of various sectors of economy, e.g"
3355,"agriculture, irrigation, manufacturing, power, construction, transport, communication, social infrastructure and services, etc, are are taken into consideration to which various sets of schemes or programmes are to be formulised and implemented"
3356,"regional planning approach in this approach, the main emphasis is on to draw such plans which may help to reduce regional disparities and bring uniform economic development"
3357,target area planning the core focus of planning process is in promoting economically backward areas
3358,"it is important that for proper economic development of a region, there is a need of resource base as well as technology and investment simultaneously, because sometimes resources rich regions also remain backward"
3359,"after having about one and half decade planning experience, it is realised that our economic development is still facing the regional imbalances"
3360,"in order to encounter both regional and social disparities, the planning commission introduced the ‘target area’ and ‘target group approaches’ to planning"
3361,"some of the programmes which are directed towards the development of these two approaches are as follows: target area programmes target area has the following programmes such as: command area development programme drought prone area development programme desert development programme hill area development programme target group programmes target groups has the following programmes such as: the small farmers development agency (sfda) marginal farmers development agency (mfda) in the eighth five year plan, hill areas, north-eastern states, tribal areas and backward areas were taken into consideration in order to develop special area programmes"
3362,"planning related to area development programme hill area development programme it covers 15 districts comprising all the hilly districts of uttar pradesh (present uttarakhand), mikir hill and north cachar hills of assam, darjiling district of west bengal and nilgiri district of tamil nadu"
3363,"it was recommended in 1981, by the national committee on the development of backward area, that the hill areas having a height above 600 m and not covered under tribal sub-plan be treated as backward hill areas"
3364,"the aims of hill area development programmes are as follows: development of horticulture, plantation agriculture, animal husbandry, poultry, forestry and small scale and village industry were the main objectives of the programme through which exploitation of local resources may become possible"
3365,"the detailed plans were based on topographical, ecological, economic and social conditions of the hill areas"
3366,drought prone area programme (dpap) this programme was started during the fourth five year plan
3367,the main objectives of drought prone area programme are as follows: this plan mainly emphasised on generating employment opportunities to the people of drought prone areas along with creating productive assets
3368,"besides, irrigation projects, land development programmes, afforestation, grassland development and creation of basic rural infrastructure such as rural electrification, roads, market, credit and services were also its main priorities"
3369,the national committee on development of backward areas found that this programme was mostly confined to the development of agriculture and allied sectors along with restoration of ecological balance
3370,the society due to burden of population was bound to utilise the marginal lands for agriculture and as a result led ecological degradation
3371,"thus, it was observed that there is an urgent need to generate alternative employment opportunities in these regions"
3372,drought prone regions there are 67 districts (entire or partly) in india identified by planning commission (1967) as drought prone regions
3373,"irrigation commission (1972), demarcated the drought affected areas and also introduced the criterion of 30% irrigated land"
3374,"these areas are semi-arid and arid tract of rajasthan, gujarat, western madhya pradesh, marathwada, region of maharashtra, rayalseema and telangana plateaus of andhra pradesh, karnataka plateau and higlands and interior parts of tamil nadu"
3375,"due to the advancement in irrigation facilities, haryana, punjab and northern rajasthan have become protected regions"
3376,integrated tribal development project in bharmaur region the region lies between 32° 111 n and 32° 41′ n latitudes and 76° 22′ e and 76° 53′ e longitudes
3377,"spread over an area of about 1818 sq km, the region mostly lies between 1500 m to 3700 m above the mean sea level"
3378,this region popularly known as the homeland of gaddis and is surrounded by lofty mountains on all sides
3379,it has pir panjal in the north and dhaula dhar in the south
3380,"in the east, the extension of dhaula dhar converges with pir panjal near rohtang pass"
3381,"the river ravi and its tributaries, the budhil and the tundahen, drain this territory and carve out deep gorges"
3382,"these rivers divide the region into four physiographic divisions called holi, khani, kugti and tundah areas"
3383,it means monthly temperature in january remains 4°c and in july 26°c
3384,area and life of people in bharmaur the area and life of people of bharmaur region are as follows: the tribal area covers bharmaur and holi tehsils of chamba district of himachal pradesh
3385,"it is one of the most backward area economically as well as socially in himachal pradesh and also a notified tribal region since 21st november, 1975"
3386,"the area is occupied by a tribal group of community named ‘gaddi’, who practised transhumance and speak ‘gaddiali’ dialect"
3387,"according to 2001 census, the total population of the area was 39113 i.e"
3388,"people of the area face major problems as the economy is mostly affected by its harsh climate, low resource base and fragile environment"
3389,"economy in the area of bharmaur traditionally, subsistence agriculture-cum-pastoral activities such as growing food grains and animal husbandry like sheep and goat are the main activities of these people"
3390,"integrated tribal development project (itdp) in 1970s, gaddis were included in the list of scheduled tribes and in the same period the development process of tribal area of this region started"
3391,"later in 1974 under the fifth five year plan, the tribal sub-plan was introduced and bharmaur was designed as one of the five integrated tribal development project (itdp) in himachal pradesh"
3392,aims and priorities of the intergrated tribal development project are as follows: improving the quality of life of the gaddis
3393,narrowing the gap in the level of development between bharmaur and other districts of himachal pradesh
3394,"the highest priority was on development of transport and communications, agriculture and allied activities as well as social and community services"
3395,"the main achievements of the tribal sub-plan are as follows: infrastructural facilities infrastructural facilities of tribal sub-plan are as follows: development of infrastructure i.e schools, health care facilities, potable water, roads, communications and electricity supply"
3396,villages located along the river ravi in holi and khani areas are main beneficiaries infrastructural development
3397,"social benefits social benefits of tribal sub-plan are as follows: there are tremendous increase in literacy rate, e.g, the female literacy rate in the region increased from 1.88% in 1971 to 65% in 2011"
3398,"economic benefits as the gaddis had practiced traditionally, subsistence agriculture cum-pastroral economy, later on during the last three decades of twentieth century, pulses and other cash crops became one of the main crops of the region"
3399,"some shortcomings to itdp in terms of infrastructural facilities, the remote villages in tundah and kugti areas are still remained unaffected"
3400,the importance of pastoralism has been decreasing day-by-day as only about one tenth of the total households practice transhumance
3401,"but, still a sizeable portion of the gaddis migrate to kangra and its fringing zone in order to earn living from wage labour during cold season"
3402,overview of planning perspective in india india has centralised planning and the planning commission has been assigned to administer the functions of planning in india
3403,"being a statutory body, planning commission is headed by the prime minister and has a deputy chairman and members"
3404,"five year plans are responsible to carry out the planning in india which are as follows: the first five year plan launched in 1951 and covered the period, 1951-52 to 1955-56"
3405,"second and third five year plans covered the period from 1956-57 to 1960-61 and 1961-62 to 1965-1966, respectively"
3406,two successive droughts during mid sixties (1965-66 and 1966-67) and war with pakistan in 1965 forced plan holiday in 1966-67 and 1968-69
3407,this period was covered by annual plans which are also termed as rolling plans
3408,the fourth five year plan began in 1969-70 and ended in 1973-74
3409,"following this the fifth five year plan began in 1974-75, but it was terminated by the government one year earlier i.e"
3410,the seventh five year plan covered the period between 1985 and 1990
3411,"once again, due to the political instability and initiation of liberalisation policy, the eighth five year plan got delayed"
3412,the tenth five year plan began in 2002 and ended in 2007
3413,the eleventh five year plan started in 2007 and ended in 2012
3414,the twelfth five year plan in 2012 and it is still in progress
3415,"sustainable development in the 1960, this was the period when people throughout the world were much concerned about the environmental issues because of undesirable effects of industrial development and thus, the concept of sustainable development emerged in western world"
3416,"this level of fear among environmentalists and common people reached at its peak with the publication of the population bomb’ by ehrlich in 1968 and ‘the limits to growth’ by meadows aims of sustainable development the main aim of sustainable development is to take care of economic, social and ecological spheres of development during the present times as well as conserve all the resources in such a manner that these can be retain for future generations"
3417,"so, there is a need of changing our attitude towards nature as well as economic development"
3418,"concept of development development is a dynamic concept and has evolved in the second half of twentieth century, used to describe the state of particular societies and the process of changes experienced by them"
3419,"in early human history, the main criteria of determination of a society’s state was the interaction process between human societies and their bio-physical environment"
3420,societies helped in the development of various levels of technology and institutions upon which human-environment process depend
3421,"these have helped in increasing the pace of human environment interaction, therefore, the momentum generated and festinated technological progress and transformation and creation of institutions"
3422,"after the period of world war ii, the two important terms i.e"
3423,"but due to unequal distribution, a faster rate of growth in poverty is experienced by even the developed nations having high economic growth"
3424,"then, redistribution with growth and ‘growth and equity’ broaden the term development in 1970s"
3425,"now, the concept of development not only restricted to economic sphere alone, but also incorporates balance and equality among people in term of welfare and quality of life of people, health education and other facilities, equal opportunity to all and ensuring political and civil rights"
3426,"hence, the concept of development has become multi-dimensional and stands for postive, irreversible transformation of the economy, society and environment"
3427,"world commission on environment and development (wced) the united nations established a world commission on environment and development (wced), after concerning the opinion of world community on the environmental issues"
3428,"the wced was headed by the norwegian prime minister, gro harlem brundtland"
3429,"the commission gave its report entitled ‘our common future’ in 1987, also known as brundtland report"
3430,"in this report, ‘sustainable development’ took into consideration and defined as ‘a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’"
3431,measures for promotion of sustainable development as we have seen that this project has affected the ecological sustainablity and physical environment of the region badly
3432,"so, attaining the goal of sustainable development in command area requires such measures that can achieve ecological, social and economic sustainabality, simultaneously"
3433,"hence, five of the seven measures have been proposed in this respect such as: rigorous implementation of water management policy is the first and foremost requirement of this project"
3434,"stage i and stage ii comprising of protective irrigation and extensive irrigation for crops and pasture development, respectively according to the canal project"
3435,by and large water intensive crops shall be avoided and plantation crops such as fruits shall be encouraged by folks
3436,"in order to reduce the conveyance loss of water, few important programmes shall be taken into account such as the cad (command area development) programmes i.e"
3437,warabandi system (means equal distribution of canal water in the command area of outlet)
3438,the areas should be reclaimed that got affected by water logging and soil salinity
3439,"the eco-development is a must, especially in the fragile environment of stage ii, through afforestation, shelterbelt, plantation and pasture development activities"
3440,"by providing a decent financial and institutional support for cultivation of the land, allottees who have poor economic background, can be prove a positive step towards achieving the social sustainability in the region"
3441,"the economic sustainability can be attained through expanding the economic sector which must include agriculture and allied activities along with other economic sectors, as a whole"
3442,"hence, we will then find diversification of economic base and establishment of functional linkages between basic villages, agro-service centres and market centres"
3443,"promotion of sustainable development in indira gandhi canal command area it is one of the largest canal systems in india, conceived by kanwar sain in 1948"
3444,this project was launched on 31st march 1958 that transformed a desert into green land
3445,the origin place of the canal is at harike barrage in punjab state and goes parallel to pakistan border at an average distance of 40 km in thar desert of rajasthan (marusthali)
3446,"9060, km is the total planned length of the system catering to the irrigation needs of a total culturable command area of 19.63 lakh hectares"
3447,the canal has two irrigation system such as ‘flow system’ and ‘lift system’
3448,around 70% land of the command area is irrigated by flow system and rest 30% land by lift system
3449,"there are tw’o stages through which the construction work of the canal system has been done such as: stage i of indra gandhi canal command area this command area covers ganganagar, hanumangarh and northern part of bikaner districts"
3450,its culturable command area is 5.53 lakh hectares along with gentle undulating topography
3451,"in this stage, the irrigation system was introduced in early 1960s"
3452,"stage ii of indira gandhi canal command area this stage covers 14.10 lakh hectares cultarable area of bikaner, jaisalmer, barmer, jodhpur, nagpur and churu districts"
3453,the main characteristics of the area are: hot desert with shifting sands dunes
3454,"in the lift canal, water is lifted up to make it to flow against the slope of the land"
3455,all the lift canals of this system originate at the left bank of main canal while all the canals on the right bank of main canal are flow channels
3456,"effects of indira gandhi canal irrigation there are various effects of indira gandhi canal irrigation on environment and on agricultural economy: effects on environment the environment of the areas is influenced by this project both positively and negatively: positive effect now, there is sufficient soil moisture availability for a longer duration"
3457,a considerable reduction in wind erosion and siltation of canal systems have also been recorded
3458,"negative effect due to intensive irrigation and excessive use of water, an alarming rate of water logging and soil salinity have been recorded"
3459,effects on agriculture there are some positive and negative effect on agriculture: positive effect this canal irrigation led to increase in cultivated land and intensity of cropping
3460,"wheat, rice, cotton, groundnut replaced the drought resistant crops like gram, bajra, and jowar"
3461,negative effect intensive irrigation has also became a cause of water logging and soil salinity
3462,"so, in the near future it may hampers the sustainability of agriculture"

3465,large scale industries medium scale industries mall scale and cottage industries on the basis of ownership: public sector industries private sector industries joint and cooperative sector on the basis of use of finished goods: basic goods industries capital goods industries intermediate goods industries consumers goods industries on the basis of raw materials used by them: agriculture based industries forest based industries mineral based industries industrially processed raw material based industries on the basis of nature of the manufactured products: metallurgical industries mechanical engineering industries chemical and allied industries textiles industries food processing industries electricity generation electronics communication industries location of industries location of industries is determined by important factors i.e
3466,"raw materials, power resources, water, labour, markets and the transport facilities"
3467,most of the manufacturing industries are located at a place where cost of production and cost of delivery of finished goods are least
3468,nature of raw materials and finished goods decide the cost of transportation
3469,factors of industrial location the following factors influence the location of industries: raw materials industries using raw materials which are perishable or lose weight in the process of manufacture are usually located near the source of the raw materials
3470,"for example, sugar mills, pulp industries, copper smelting, pig iron industries, etc"
3471,"bokaro, durgapur ) or near source of iron-ore (bhadravati, bhilai, rourkela) as both iron-ore and coal lose their weight during the process of manufacturing of steel"
3472,power power is must for every industry so supply of power should be ensured before locating any industry
3473,"market market is an important factor for market oriented industries as market provide outlets for manufactured products like heavy machines, machine tools, heavy chemicals, to sell finished goods"
3474,"for example, petroleum refineries like koyali, mathura and barauni are located near markets so that the products derived from them can be used as raw material in other industries"
3475,transport it is important for the location of industries to move goods and labour from industrial area to markets and others
3476,"for example, around delhi, mumbai, chennai and kolkata, the concentration of industries is maximum"
3477,labour it is another important factor of the location of industries
3478,"due to our large population, labour is quite mobile and is available in large numbers"
3479,"historical factors colonial influence like competition from the british goods and the british discriminatory policies, are also important reasons for the emergence of some of our industrial nodes (like, mumbai, kolkata and chennai) and manufacture centres (like murshidabad, dhaka, bhadohi, surat, vadodara, kozhikode, coimbatore, mysore, etc)"
3480,"industrial policy to bring balanced regional development and to eradicate regional disparities in the economy, are the main objectives of our democratic country"
3481,india attempts to promote backward areas like tribal areas into economic development process by providing lots of incentives
3482,"for example, establishment of iron and steel industry in bhilai and rourkela were based on decision to develop backward tribal areas of the country"
3483,major industries some of the major industries of our country are discussed below: the iron and steel industry the iron and steel industry provides basic infrastructure to almost all sectors of the indian industry
3484,"the raw materials used in this industry, iron-ore, cooking coal, limestone, dolomite, manganese and fire clay are found in parts of chhattisgarh, northern odisha, jharkhand and western west bengal"

3489,"in 1937, the steel corporation of bengal was established in association with iisco by setting up another unit at bunpur (west bengal)"
3490,"iisco gets its raw materials from different source regions like: coal from damodar valley coal fields (raniganj, jharia and ramgarh)"
3491,"later in 1972-73, the government took over the iisco plant because of the fall of steel production"
3492,"(visl) initially named mysore iron and steel works, the visl is located at the banks of badravati in shimoga district of karnataka"
3493,"visl gets raw materials from: it gets iron ore from kemangundi in the bababudan hills, limestone and manganese from the local area"
3494,"due to unavailability of coal in this region, at the beginning charcoal was used as fuel by burning wood till 1951"
3495,"later, electric furnaces were installed which use hydroelectricity from the jog falls hydel power project"
3496,"during the second five years plan (1956-61), three new public sector integrated steel plants were set up with foreign collaboration i.e"
3497,"rourkela in odisha, bhilai in chhattisgarh and durgapur in west bengal"
3498,"in 1973, the steel authority of india limited (sail) was created to manage these plants"
3499,rourkela steel plant this plant was established in 1959 in the sundargarh district of odisha in collaboration with germany
3500,this plant gets its raw materials from different sources region like: coal from jharia

3658,"during recent years, a change has been recorded in the composition of commodities in india’s international trade"
3659,there is a decline in the share of agriculture and allied products whereas shares of petroleum and crude products and other commodities have increased
3660,the share of petroleum products has increased mainly because of the rise in petroleum prices and increase in the petroleum refining capacity of india
3661,"a huge decline is registered in the export of traditional items like, coffee, spices, tea, pulses, etc due to the tough international competition"
3662,"though an increase has been registered in floricultural products, fresh fruits, marine products and sugar, etc"
3663,but manufacturing sector alone accounted for 68% of india’s total value of export in 2010-11
3664,the major competitors of india are china and other east asian countries
3665,"apart from this, the gems and jewellery are other commodities that have larger share in india’s international trade"
3666,"changing patterns of the composition of india’s import during 1950s and 1960s, india faced serious food shortage, thus the country had to import food grain, capital goods, machinery and equipments at large scale"
3667,the balance of payment was adverse as imports were more than export inspite of all the efforts of imports substitution
3668,"after 1970s, the success of green revolution discontinued the food grain import"
3669,but the energy crises of 1973 replaced the import of food grains by fertilizers and petroleum as the prices of petroleum had been raised
3670,"besides, other imported goods were machine and equipment, special steel, edible oil and chemicals"
3671,"according to economic survey 2011-12, petroleum products have registered a rapid increase in import goods"
3672,it is a raw material for petrochemical industries and also used as fuel
3673,the increase signifies the tempo of rising industrialisation and improvement in standard of living
3674,periodic price rise of petroleum in the international market may be another reason for this increase
3675,"import of capital goods like non-electrical machinery, transport equipment, manufactures of metals and machine tools registered a steady increase"
3676,this increase could be because of increasing demand in the export oriented industrial and domestic sectors
3677,import of food and allied products registered a decrease because of a sudden decline in imports of edible oils
3678,"pearls and semi-precious stones, gold and silver, metalliferrous ores and metal scrap, non-ferrous metals, electronic goods, etc are other important items of india’s import"
3679,direction of trade india is a trading partner with most of the countries and major trading blocks of the world
3680,india has goal to double its share in international trade within the next 5 years
3681,"to achieve this objective, india has started to adopt suitable measures which includes import liberalisation, reduction in import duties, de-licensing and change from process to product patents"
3682,india has created an example in terms of percentage of asia and asean (association of south-east asian nations) in total trade of world has increased
3683,it was 33.3% in 2000-01 and it increased to 57.3% in the 2011-12
3684,"in contrast to this, the share of europe and america decreased from 42.5% to 30.8%"
3685,this has helped india to survive during the global crisis in europe and america
3686,"with the development of india’s trade direction, india’s trading share with different countries also changed"
3687,now uae has displaced usa as it was india’s largest trading partner during 2010-11
3688,"after uae, china is the second largest trading partner with india continuing this position from 2008-09 to 2010-11"
3689,india’s foreign trade is mainly carried through oceanic and air routes
3690,"foreign trade via land route is only limited to the neighbouring countries such as nepal, bhutan, bangladesh and pakistan"
3691,sea ports as gateways of international trade india has a long history of international trade via sea ports as it has long coastline and is opened to sea from three sides
3692,it is interesting to know that india has more sea ports on west coast than its east coast
3693,"after coming of the european traders and colonisation of the country by the british, the indian ports have emerged as gateways of international trade"
3694,there are some parts which have very vast area of influence and some have limited area of influence
3695,"major and minor ports at present, india has 12 major and 185 minor or intermediate ports"
3696,"for major ports, central government is responsible for deciding the policies and regulate their functions and for minor ports, state government is responsible for the same functions stated above"
3697,"a larger port of total traffic is handled by major ports, e.g"
3698,about 71% of the india’s oceanic traffic was handled by the the 12 major ports during 2008-09
3699,the britishers used these ports to export natural resources of india; particularly from their hinterland but this trend was discontinued after 1947
3700,karachi port to pakistan and chittagong port to bangladesh (erstwhile east-pakistan)
3701,"but india recovered successfully from this loss by opening many new ports, for instance, kandla in the west and the diamond harbour near kolkata on river hugli in the east"

3763,different governments saw advantages in some criteria and disadvantages in others depending on their interests and aspirations

3777,india is the world’s largest democracy and the second most populous country in the world
3778,the country’s economic emergence on the world stage is another factor that perhaps justifies india’s claim to a permanent seat in the security council

3780,the un in a unipolar world it is believed by many countries that the reform and restructuring of the un could help the un cope better with a unipolar world in which the us was the most powerful country
3781,the us stands as the only superpower after the disintegration of ussr hence us power cannot be easily checked
3782,"as the single largest contributor to the un, the us has unmatched financial power"
3783,the un is not therefore a great balance to the us
3784,"nevertheless, in a unipolar world in which the us is dominant, the un can and has served to bring the us and the rest of the world into discussions over various issues"

3807,"since 1997 onwards, a new member to be added to the un should fulfil the parameters of being a major economic and military power, contributor to un budget, a populous one, should respect democracy and human rights and to make council more representative"

3809,"india is a big supporter of restructuring of the un to promote development and cooperation among states, to composition of security council arid to include more representation in council for its political support"

3811,"some countries question india’s inclusion as permanent members in the security council on the basis of its troubled relationship with pakistan, nuclear weapon capabilities, and if india included, some emerging powers (brazil, germany, japan, south africa) will also be accommodated"
3812,france and the usa advocate that africa and south america must be represented for they do not have any representation in the present structure
3813,"the un can not serve as a balance against us dominance because the us is the only superpower after 1991 and may ignore any international organisation economically and’ militarily, its veto power also can stop any move damaging its interests as well as enjoys a considerable say in the choice of secretary general of the un"
3814,"despite the above mentioned strong activities of the us, the un serves a purpose in bringing the world together in dealing with conflicts and social and economic issues"
3815,the un provides a space within which arguments against specific us attitude and policies are heard and compromised

3851,the disintegration of ussr led to the beginning of the us hegemony in 1991
3852,kuwait was invaded by iraq in august 1990 and was subsequently annexed
3853,"after a series of diplomatic attempts failed at convincing iraq to quit its aggression, the united nations mandated the liberation of kuwait by force"
3854,"this decision of un was hailed by the us president george hw bush as the emergence of a ‘new world order.’ the first gulf war took place in which iraq was defeated by a coalition force of 6,60,000 troops from 34 countries"
3855,it was known as ‘operation desert storm’ or ‘first gulf war’
3856,it revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the us military capability and other countries
3857,the clinton years george hw bush lost the us presidential elections of 1992 to william jefferson (bill) clinton of the democratic party
3858,"during this era, it was believed that the us had withdrawn into its internal affairs and was not fully engaged in world politics"
3859,"the government led by clinton focused on ‘soft issues’ like democracy promotion, climate change and world trade rather than ‘hard politics’"
3860,"firstly, in 1999 in response to yugoslavian actions against the pre-dominantly albanian population in the province of kosovo"
3861,"secondly, in response to the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi, kenya and dar-es-salaam"
3862,"‘operation infinite reach’, launched by the us, was a series of cruise missile strikes on al-qaeda terrorist targets in sudan and afghanistan"
3863,"9/11 and the ‘global war on terror on 11th september 2001, four american commercial aircrafts were hijacked and flew into important buildings in the us"
3864,"the first and second airline crashed into the north and south towers of the world trade centre (new york), the third crashed into the pentagon building (arlington, virginia) and the fourth aircraft came down in a field in pennsylvania"
3865,the us launched ‘operation enduring freedom’ as a part of its ‘global war on terror’
3866,"the operation was against all those suspected to be behind the 9/11 attack, mainly al-qaeda and the taliban regime in afghanistan"
3867,arrests were made all over the world by the us forces often without the knowledge of the government of the persons being arrested
3868,these persons were transported across countries and detained in secret prisons
3869,"the iraq invasion operation iraqi freedom’ was launched by the us on 19th march, 2003 and was joined by more than forty other countries"
3870,the purpose of the invasion was to prevent iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction (wmd)
3871,"as there was no evidence of wmd, it is speculated that the invasion was motivated by other objectives such as controlling iraqi oilfields, etc"
3872,the us invasion of iraq was both a military and political failure as around 3000 us military personnel were lost and iraqi casualities were much higher
3873,constraints on american power there are three constraints on american power
3874,the second constraint is domestic in nature and stems from the open nature of american society
3875,there is a deep scepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in american political culture
3876,the third constraint on american power is the north atlantic treaty organisation (nato) which is only organisation in the international system that could possibly moderate the exercise of american power
3877,"india’s relationship with the us during the cold war, india closest friendship was with the soviet union"
3878,"over the years, india decided to liberalise its economy and integrate it with the global economy"
3879,this made india an attractive economic partner for a number of countries including the us
3880,they include : technological dimension the role of the indian-american diaspora
3881,there are three different strategies to decide what kind of relationship india should have with usa
3882,"they are as follows : those indian analysts who see international politics in terms of military power, prefer that india should maintain its distance from us and should focus upon increasing its own national power"
3883,other analysts see the growing convergence of interests between us and india as a historic opportunity for india
3884,a third group of analysts advocate that india should take the lead in establishing the coalition of countries from developing world
3885,indo-us relations are too difficult to manage by a sole strategy
3886,there should be mixing of foreign policy strategies of deal with the us
3887,"meaning of hegemony the word ‘hegemony’ means the leadership or predominance of one state over others by virtue of its military, economic, political power and cultural superiority"
3888,"in world politics, countries and groups of countries are engaged in constantly trying to gain and retain power"
3889,it is important to understand the distribution of power among the countries of the world in order to understand world politics
3890,"during the cold war era, there were two superpowers, the us and the ussr"
3891,"but after the disintegration of ussr, only a single power was left i.e"
3892,the international system dominated by a sole superpower or hyper-power is sometimes called a ‘unipolar system’
3893,"hegemony as hard power hegemony relates to the relations, patterns and balances of military capability between states"
3894,the base of us power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power
3895,the military dominance of the us is not just based on higher military spending but on a qualitative gap
3896,"but still, the us invasion of iraq reveals weakness of american power as it was not able to force the iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the us-led coalition"
3897,hegemony as structural power the idea behind this type of hegemony is that an open world economy requires a hegemon or dominant power to support its creation and existence
3898,"in this sense, hegemony is reflected in the role played by the us in providing global public goods"
3899,"the best examples of global public goods are sea-lanes of communication (slocs), internet, roads, etc"
3900,"the economic preponderance of the us is inseparable from its structural power, which is the power to shape the global economy in a particular way"
3901,another example of the structural power of the us is the academic degree called the masters in business administration (mba)
3902,"hegemony as soft power in this type of hegemony, it implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres"
3903,it suggests that a dominant power not only possess military power but also ideological resources to shape the behaviour of competing and lesser powers
3904,the us predominance in the world is based not only on its military power and economic powers but on its cultural presence
3905,"during the cold war, the us scored notable victories in the area of structural power and soft power rather than hard power"
3906,overcoming the hegemony it is important to understand that there is no single power to balance the us military
3907,there are various strategies which can be helpful to overcome the hegemony
3908,"according to the bandwagon strategy, it is suggested that instead of engaging in activities opposed to the hegemonic power, it is advisable to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system"
3909,hide strategy implies staying as far removed from the dominant power as possible
3910,"china, russia and the european union are many examples of this behaviour"
3911,another belief is that resistance to american hegemony may come from non-state actors rather than other states
3912,"it is believed that challenges to us hegemony will come from a combination of non-government organisations (ngos), social movements and public opinion"
3913,"it covers two continents—the north and the south america, the us is only one of the countries of the continent which is a symbol of us hegemony"
3914,"after the disintegration of ussr in 1991, the first instance of us hegemony came into observation through operation desert storm by the un during first gulf war to retreat iraqi forces from kuwait"
3915,this operation was dominated and won by the us due to vast technological gap between the us military capability and other states
3916,"william jefferson (bill) clinton, the newly elected president of the us in 1992 and again in 1996, focused on soft issues like democracy promotions, climate change and world trade rather than of military power and security"
3917,"the above mentioned policies of the us were contradicted in response to yugoslavian action against predominant albanian population in kosovo by targeting bombards through operation infinite against al-qaeda in response to the bombings of us embassies in nairobi, kenya, dar-es-salaam and tanzania in 1998"
3918,"on 11 september 2001, nineteen hijackers hailing from a number of arab countries took control of four commercial aircrafts shortly after take off and crushed into world trade centre in new york, pentagon building in arlington"
3919,"virginia (us defence department) and the capital building of the us congress in pennysylvania, came to be known as event of 9/11 in the us"
3920,the us launched operation enduring freedom against all those suspected behind attack in 9/11 mainly al-qaeda and taliban regime
3921,"the us forces made arrests all over the world, transported and detained the persons in secret prisons like guantanamo bay, a us navy base in cuba where the prisoners did not enjoy the protection of international law or the law of their own country or that of the us"
3922,even the un representatives were not allowed to meet these persons
3923,"on 19 march 2003, the us launched operation iraqi freedom to prevent iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction (wmd) in the ostensible purpose to control oil fields and installing a regime in iraq friendly to us"
3924,"hegemony is an international system with only one centre of power to be gained and retained in the form of military domination, economic political chart and central superiority which was enjoyed only by the us after disintegration of soviet union"
3925,hegemony as hard power is based on military capabilities of a country and the us has proved it
3926,the us today spends more on its military than the next 12 powers and even technologically no other power can match with the us
3927,hegemony as structural power must sustain global structure in economic sense
3928,the us has provided global public goods as sea lanes of communications (slocs) as well as accounts for 15 percent of world trade if eu is included and 20 per cent in world economy
3929,the us has contributed basic economic structure in the form of bretton woods system and degree in mba
3930,"hegemony as soft power implies class ascendency in social, political and ideological spheres which is more effective than coercion to more hand in hand and the us was proved ultimately triumphant in this"
3931,"though the us has been a hegemonic power, still it experiences some constraints in itself as institutional architecture (division of power)"

4225,the root of this danger is the other country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty and independence
4226,there are three choices with the government in response to the threat of war
4227,"these choices are to surrender, to prevent the other side from attack and to defend itself during the war and four components of traditional security i.e"
4228,deterrence means prevention of war; defence means limiting or ending war; balance of power means there should be balance between bigger and smaller countries and alliance building means coalition of states
4229,a good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack
4230,"according to the traditional view of security, most threats to a country’s security come from outside its borders"
4231,"within a country, the threat of violence is regulated by an acknowledged central authority i.e"
4232,"but in world politics, each country has to be responsible for its own security"
4233,traditional notions of internal security traditional security must concern itself with internal security which has not been given so much importance due to various reasons
4234,"after the second world war, internal security was more or less assured to the powerful countries on the earth"
4235,most of the european countries faced no serious threats from groups or communities living within those borders
4236,the main concern for the external security was the era of cold war
4237,the colonies which became independent were under fear of conversion of cold war into a hot war
4238,the newly independent african and asian countries were more worried about the prospect of military conflict with neighbouring countries
4239,they were worried about internal threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent countries
4240,"traditional security and cooperation it is universally accepted that war can takes place for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide"
4241,"traditional views of security also gives importance to other forms of cooperation like disarmament, arms control and confidence building"
4242,disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons
4243,united states and soviet union signed a number of other arms control treaties
4244,confidence building means a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals
4245,force is both the principle threat to security and the principle means of achieving security in traditional security
4246,non-traditional notions the non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the condition of human existence
4247,non-traditional views of security have been called ‘human security’ or ‘global security’
4248,by human security we mean the protection of people more than the protection of states
4249,proponents (supporters) of the ‘narrow concept’ of human security focus on violent threats to individuals
4250,"on the other hand, proponents of the ‘broad concept’ of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disaster"
4251,"the idea of global security emerged in the 1990s in response to the global nature of threats such as global warming, aids and so on"
4252,new sources of threats some new sources of threats have emerged about which the world is concerned to a large extent
4253,"these includes terrorism, human rights, global poverty, migration and health epidemics"
4254,terrorism refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately
4255,"the first is political rights, second is economic and social rights and the third type is the rights of colonised people"
4256,rich states are becoming richer whereas poor states are getting poorer
4257,"poverty in the south has also led to large scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities, in the north"
4258,"health epidemics such as h1v-aids, bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) have been increasing across countries through migration"
4259,it is important to understand that the expansion of the concept of security does not mean to include everything
4260,"to qualify as a security problem, an issue must share a minimum common criterion"
4261,cooperative security dealing with certain issues of security require cooperation rather than military confrontation
4262,"military help can be taken to deal with terrorism but it will be of no use in dealing with issues like poverty, migration and so on"
4263,"it becomes important to devise strategies that involve international cooperation which can be bilateral, regional, continental or global"
4264,"cooperative security may also involve a variety of other players, both international and national"
4265,but cooperative security may also involve the use of force as a last resort
4266,the international community may have to sanction the use of force to deal with dictatorship
4267,india’s security strategy indian’s security strategy depends upon four broad components strengthening the military capabilities is the first component of india’s security strategy because india has been involved in conflicts with its neighbours
4268,the second component of india’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests
4269,the third important component of india’s security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country
4270,the fourth component is to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery
4271,"‘security’ is freedom from ‘threats’, security protects core values from threatening by preventing, limiting and ending the war"
4272,"external threats experience military war, balance of power and alliance building threats whereas internal includes internal peace and order"
4273,"the means of traditional security limit the violence upto maximum extent through disarmament, arms-control and confidence building"
4274,arms control regulates acquisition of weapons and confidence building share ideas and information with rival countries
4275,non-traditional security focuses on human and global security by covering all of human kinds
4276,"human security in a narrow sense protects individuals from internal violence only whereas broadly it protects from hunger, diseases and natural disasters"
4277,"global security responds to threats like global warming, international terrorism, health epidemics like aids, bird flue and so on"
4278,"new sources of threats include terrorism, human rights, global poverty, migration, and health epidemics"
4279,"human rights threats involve political rights, economic and social rights as well as rights of colonised people and indigenous minorities"
4280,global poverty suffers from low per capita income and economic growth and high population migration creates international political friction as states pursue different rules for migrants and refugees
4281,"health epidemics cover hiv-aids, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) through migration business, tourism and military operations"
4282,"cooperative security is required to alleviate poverty, manage migration, refugee movements and control epidemics"
4283,"cooperation may be bilateral, regional, continental or global depending on the nature of threat and willingness and ability of countries to respond either nationally or internationally"
4284,india has faced both traditional and non-traditional threats to its security
4285,"strengthening military capabilities, to strength international norms and institutions, to meet security challenges inside the border and to develop to lift citizens out of poverty, missing and economic inequalities"
4286,words that matter security: an essence for existence of human life to protect from threats either external or internal
4287,disarmament: it bounds states to give up certain kinds of weapons to avoid mass destruction

4305,but the consequence of the end of the second world war was the rise of two new powers on the global stage
4306,the united states and the soviet union became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth
4307,"but the cold war inspite of being an intense form of rivalry between great powers, remained a ‘cold’ and not hot or shooting war"

4313,"the countries of the eastern europe joined the soviet camp and came to be known as ‘eastern alliance.’ the western alliance formed itself into an organisation, the north atlantic treaty organisation (nato)"
4314,the nato declared that armed attack on any one of them in europe or north america would be regarded as an attack on all of them
4315,"the eastern alliance, also known as the warsaw pact, was led by the soviet union"
4316,"in east and south east asia and in west asia (middle east), the united states built an alliance system called the south-east asian treaty organisation (seato) and the central treaty organisation (cento)"
4317,the smaller countries were of more help to the superpowers because they were the means to gain vital resources such as oil and minerals; locations to spy each other and to launch weapons
4318,arenas of the cold war the arenas of the cold war refer to areas where crisis and war occurred or threatened to occur between the alliance systems but did not cross certain limits

4324,it played a role in mediating between the two rival alliances
4325,new international economic order the challenge for the newly decolonised countries was to become more developed economically and to lift their people out of poverty
4326,the idea of a new international economic order (nieo) originated with this realisation
4327,the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) brought out a report in 1972 entitled ‘towards a new trade policy for development’
4328,the nature of non-alignment changed to give greater importance to economic issues
4329,india and the cold war india followed a two way policy regarding the cold war
4330,it did not join any of the alliances and raised voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming part of these alliances
4331,the policy of india was not ‘fleeing away’ but was in favour of actively intervening in world affairs to soften cold war rivalries
4332,the non-alignment gave india the power to take international decisions and to balance one superpower against the other

4982,(b) inflationary gap is the gap showing excess of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
4983,it is called inflationary because it leads to inflation (continuous rise in prices)
4984,"let us suppose that an imaginary economy by employing all its available resources can produce 10,000 quintals of rice"
4985,"if aggregate demand of rice is say 12,000 quintals, this demand will be called an excess demand, because aggregate supply at level of full employment of resources is only 10,000 quintals and the result of the gap of 2000 quintals will be called as inflationary gap"
4986,"in the above diagram inflationary gap is ab because at full employment y*, aggregate demand (by*) is greater than aggregate supply(ay*)"
4987,(b) increase in private investment demand because of rise in credit facilities
4988,"impacts or effects of excess demand on price, output, employment: (a) effect on general price level: excess demand gives a rise to general price level because it arises when aggregate demand is more than aggregate supply at a full employment level"
4989,(b) effect on output: excess demand has no effect on the level of output
4990,economy is at full employment level and there is no idle capacity in the economy
4991,(c) effect on employment: there will be no change in thq
4992,"the economy is already operating at full employment equilibrium, and hence, there is no unemployment"
4993,measures to control the excess demand: we can control the excess demand with the help of the following policy: (a) monetary policy (b) fiscal policy let us discuss it in detail: (a) monetary policy: monetary policy is the policy of the central bank of a countiy to control money supply and availability of credit in the economy
4994,the central bank can take the following steps: (i) quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy: these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of money/credit in the economy
4995,these instruments do not direct or restrict the flow of credit to some specific sectors of the economy
4996,they are as under • bank rate or discount rate (increase in bank rate) -> bank rate is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral (security for purpose of loan)
4997,"the thing, which has to be remembered, is that central bank lends to commercial banks and not to general public"
4998,-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation -> central bank raises bank rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
4999,"❖ it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans, which discourages investment"
5000,❖ again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
5001,"❖ thus, expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced, which will control the excess demand"
5002,• repo rate (increase in repo rate): -> repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
5003,-> these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
5004,-> it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price
5005,-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation ❖ central bank raises repo rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
5006,"❖ it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans, which discourages investment"
5007,❖ again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
5008,"❖ thus, expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced, which will control the excess demand"
5009,• reverse repo rate (increase in reverse repo rate): -> it is the rate at which the central bank (rbi) borrows money from commercial bank
5010,"-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, reverse repo rate is increased, it encourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank to earn higher return on idle cash"
5011,"it decreases the lending capability of commercial banks, which controls excess demand"
5012,• open market operations (omo) (sale of securities): -> it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
5013,"-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, central bank sells government securities and bonds to commercial bank"
5014,"with the sale of these securities, the power of commercial bank of giving loans decreases, which will control excess demand"
5015,"• increase in varying reserve requirements or legal reserve ratio: -> banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank, which is known as legal reserve ratio"
5016,one is the cash reserve ratio or crr and the other is the slr or statutory liquidity ratio
5017,"-> cash reserve ratio (increase in crr): ❖ it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits, which it is required to keep with the central bank"
5018,commercial banks have to keep with the central bank a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash reserves as a matter of law
5019,"❖ for example, if the minimum reserve ratio is 10% and total deposits of a certain bank is rs.100 crore, it will have to keep rs.10 crore with the central bank"
5020,"❖ in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, cash reserve ratio (crr) is raised to 20 per cent, the bank will have to keep rs.20 crore with the central bank, which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy, which will control excess demand"
5021,"-> statutory liquidity ratio (increase slr): ❖ it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves"
5022,"❖ in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the central bank increases statutory liquidity ratio (slr), which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy"
5023,(ii) qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy: these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
5024,they are as under: (i) imposing margin requirement on secured loans (increase): • business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
5025,bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
5026,"• so, the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement"
5027,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, central bank raises marginal requirements"
5028,this discourages borrowing because it makes people get less credit against their securities
5029,"(ii) moral suasion: • moral suasion implies persuasion, request, informal suggestion, advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank"
5030,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, it appeals for credit contraction"
5031,(iii) selective credit control (scc) [introduce credit rationing]: • in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
5032,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the central bank introduces rationing of credit in order to prevent excessive flow of credit, particularly for speculative activities"
5033,(b) fiscal policy: the expenditure and revenue policy taken by the general government to accomplish the desired goals is known as fiscal policy
5034,a general government can take the following steps: (a) revenue policy (increase taxes): (i) revenue policy is expressed in terms of taxes
5035,(ii) during inflation the government impose higher amount of taxes causing the decrease in purchasing power of the people
5036,(iii) it is so because to control excess demand we have to reduce the amount of liquidity from the economy
5037,"(b) expenditure policy (reduces expenditure): (i) government has to invest huge amount on public works like roads, buildings, irrigation works, etc"
5038,"(ii) during inflation, government should curtail (reduce) its expenditure on public works like roads, buildings, irrigation works thereby reducing the money income of the people and their demand for goods and services"
5039,(c) increase in public borrowing/public debt: (i) this measure means that government should raise loans from public and hence borrowing decreases the purchasing power of people by leaving them with lesser amount of money
5040,"(ii) so, government should resort to more public borrowing during excessive demand"
5041,"(iii) government should make long term debts more attractive so that public may use their excess liquidity amount of money in purchasing these bonds, which will reduce the liquidity amount of money in the economy and thereby inflation could be controlled deficient demand and its related concepts 1"
5042,"deficient demand or deflationary gap: (a) when in an economy, aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply at full employment level, the demand is said to be a deficient demand"
5043,(b) deflationary gap is the gap showing demand deficient of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
5044,it is called deflationary because it leads to deflation (continuous fall in prices)
5045,"(c) let us suppose that an imaginary economy by employing all its available resources can produce 10,000 quintals of rice"
5046,"if aggregate demand of rice is, say 8,000 quin tals, this demand will be called a deficient demand and the gap of 2000 quintals will be called as deflationary gap"
5047,clearly here equilibrium between ad and as is at a point less than level of full employment
5048,reasons or causes for deficient demand: the main reasons for deficient demand are apparently the decrease in four components of aggregate demand: (a) decrease in household consumption demand due to fall in propensity to consume
5049,(b) decrease in private investment demand because of fall in credit facilities
5050,impacts or effects of deficient demand: (a) effect on general price level: deficient demand causes the general price level to fall because it arises when aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply at full employment level
5051,"(b) effect on employment: due to deficient demand, investment level is reduced, which causes involuntary unemployment in the economy due to fall in the planned output"
5052,(c) effect on output: low level of investment and employment implies low level of output
5053,measures to control the deficient demand: we can control the deficient demand with the help of the following policies: (a) monetary policy (b) fiscal policy let us discuss it in detail: (a) monetary policy: monetary policy is the policy of the central bank of a country of controlling money supply and availability of credit in the economy
5054,the central bank takes the following steps: (i) quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy: these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of money/credit in the economy

5058,"-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, ❖ central bank decreases bank rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank"
5059,"❖ decrease in bank rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates, which encourages borrowers from taking loans, which encourages investment"
5060,❖ again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
5061,"❖ thus, expenditure on investment and consumption increase, which will control the deficient demand"
5062,• repo rate (decrease repo rate): -> repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
5063,-> these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
5064,-> it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price

5068,"❖ thus, expenditure on investment and consumption increase, which will control the deficient demand"
5069,• reverse repo rate (decrease reverse repo rate): -> it is the rate at which the central bank (rbi) borrows money from commercial bank
5070,"-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, reverse repo rate is decreased, it discourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank"
5071,"it increases the lending capability of commercial banks, which controls deficient demand"
5072,• open market operation (purchase of securities): -> it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
5073,"-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, central bank purchases government securities and bonds from commercial bank"
5074,"with the purchase of these securities, the power of commercial bank of giving loans increases, which will control deficient demand"
5075,"• decrease in varying reserve requirements:  -> banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank, which is known as legal reserve ratio"

5080,"100 crore, it will have to keep rs.10 crore with the central bank"
5081,"❖ in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, cash reserve ratio (crr) falls to 5 per cent, the bank will have to keep rs"
5082,"5 crore with the central bank, which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increasing credit availability in the economy, which will control deficient demand"
5083,"-> the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) (increase): ❖ it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves"
5084,"❖ in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, the central bank decreases statutory liquidity ratio (slr), which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increases credit availability in the economy"

5096,a general government has to take the following steps: (a) revenue policy (decrease in taxes): (i) revenue policy is expressed in terms of taxes
5097,(ii) during deflation the government will impose lower amount of taxes so that purchasing power of the people be increased
5098,(iii) it is so because to control deficient demand we have to increase the amount of liquidity in the economy

5100,"(ii) during deflation government should increase its expenditure on public works like roads, buildings, irrigation works thereby increasing the money income of the people and their demand for goods and services"
5101,(c) decrease in public borrowing / public debt: (i) at the time of deficient demand public borrowing should be reduced
5102,"(iii) in brief, during period of deficient demand government should adopt the pricing of deficit budget"

5104,"full employment: (i) full employment equilibrium refers to the situation where aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply, and all those who are able to work and willing to work (at the existing wage rate) are getting work"
5105,(ii) full employment doesn’t means that there is no unemployment in an economy
5106,unemployment also exists at full employment level because of voluntary unemployment
5107,"voluntary unemployment: (i) voluntary unemployment refers to the situation when a person is unemployed because he is not willing to work at the existing wage rate, even when work is available"
5108,"(ii) suppose, if the market wage rate for mba in the industries is rs.8,000 a month, but some of the qualified mba’s refuse to accept job at rs.8,000 a month, they will be considered as voluntarily unemployed"
5109,involuntary unemployment: (i) involuntary unemployment refers to a situation in which all able and willing persons to work at existing wage-rate do not find work
5110,"excess demand: when in an economy, aggregate demand exceeds “aggregate supply at full employment level”, the demand is said to be an excess demand"
5111,inflationary gap: it is the gap showing excess of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
5112,it is called inflationary because it leads to inflation (continuous rise in prices)
5113,"deficient demand: when in an economy, aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply at full employment level, the demand is said to be a deficient demand"
5114,deflationary gap: it is the gap showing deficient of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
5115,it is called deflationary because it leads to deflation (continuous fall in prices)
5116,monetary policy: it is the policy of the central bank of a country to control money supply and availability of credit in the economy
5117,quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy: these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of money/credit in the economy
5118,qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy: these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
5119,bank rate: it is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral (security for purpose of loan)
5120,repo rate: it is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
5121,reverse repo rate: it is the rate at which the central bank (rbi) borrows moneyfrom commercial bank
5122,open market operation: it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
5123,"cash reserve ratio: it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits, which it is required to keep with the central bank"
5124,"statutory liquidity ratio: it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves"
5125,marginal requirement: business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
5126,bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
5127,"so, the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement"
5128,"moral suasion: it implies persuasion, request, informal suggestion, advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank 16"
5129,selective credit control: in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
5130,fiscal policy: the expenditure and revenue policy taken by the general government to accomplish the desired goals is known as fiscal policy
5131,"full employment equilibrium: it refers to the situation where aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply, and all those who are able to work and willing to work (at the existing wage rate) are getting work"
5132,"voluntary unemployment: it refers to the situation when a person is unemployed because he is not willing to work at the existing wage rate, even when work is available"
5133,involuntary unemployment: it refers to a situation in which all able and willing persons to work at existing wage-rate do not find work
5134,"green gnp: green gnp refers to gnp adjusted for loss of value due to, (a) environmental degradation; and (b) depletion of natural resources on account of overall production activity in the economy"
5135,activities excluded from gdpmp: the activities are as follows: (a) purely financial transactions: it may be of three types: (i) buying and selling of securities (ii) government transfer payments (iii) private transfer payments (i) buying and selling of securities: • in financial markets potential savers and investors buy and sell financial assets such as shares and bonds
5136,"• while someone buys a share, there is only a transfer of ownership right"
5137,• trading in financial instruments does not imply production of final goods and services
5138,(ii) government transfer payments: • transfer payments are payments for which no goods and services are provided in exchange
5139,"are examples for government transfer payment as there is no production of final goods and services in response to transfer payment, transfer payments are not included in gnp"
5140,"(iii) private transfer payments: • items such as pocket money given by parents to their children, elders gifting money to the young ones are private transfer payments"
5141,this is merely a transfer of money from one individual to another
5142,(b) transfer of used goods: (i) gnp refers to the value of the final goods and services produced in a given year
5143,"(ii) hence, goods produced in the previous time period cannot be included in the gnp"
5144,"for example, mr a sells his old bike to mr b for rs"
5145,"30,000 on 25th april 2011 which was purchased by mr a on 1st march 2010 for rs"
5146,"this transaction should not be included as it has already been included in the 2010 gnp and if we again include it, then it will create the problem of double counting"
5147,(c) non-market goods and services: (i) many final goods and services are not acquired through regular market transaction
5148,vegetables can be grown in the backyard instead of buying them from the super market or an electrical fault can be repaired by the house owner himself instead of hiring an electrician
5149,(ii) these are examples of non-marketed goods and services that have been consumed with using organized markets as gnp includes only those transactions that occur through market activities
5150,"(d) illegal activities: activities like gambling, black-marketing etc., should be excluded because all unlawful activities are beyond the scope of ny and also because there is statistical problem of their estimation"
5151,"(e) leisure time activities: activities like painting, growing of flowers in kitchen garden, etc"
5152,"is not included as their aim is not to earn money but to pass away free time in one’s hobby or entertainment, again there is statistical problem of measuring their satisfaction derived in painting or any other leisure activities"
5153,limitations of using gdp as an index of welfare of a country: there are many reasons behind this
5154,"these are: (a) many goods and services contributing economic welfare are not included in gdp or non-monetary exchanges: (i) there are many goods and services which are left out of estimation of national income on account of practical estimation difficulties e.g., services of housewives and other members, own account production, etc"
5155,(ii) these are left on account of non-availability of data and problem in valuation
5156,(iii) it is generally agreed that these items contribute to economic welfare
5157,"(iv) so, if we depend only on gdp, we would be underestimating economic welfare"
5158,"(b) externality: (i) when the activities of somebody result in benefits or harms to others with no payment received for the benefit and na payment made for the harm done, such benefits and harms are called externalities"
5159,"(ii) activities resulting in benefits to others are positive externalities and increase welfare; and those resulting in harm to others are called negative externalities, and thus decrease welfare"
5160,"for example, construction of a flyover or a highway reduces transport cost and journey time of its users who have not contributed anything towards its cost"
5161,expenditure on construction is included in gdp but not the positive externalities flowing from it
5162,"therefore, taking only gdp as an index of welfare understates welfare"
5163,it means that welfare is much more than it is indicated by gdp
5164,"(iv) similarly, gdp also does not take into account negative externalities"
5165,"for examples, factories produce goods but at the same time create pollution of water and air"
5166,the factories are not required to pay anything for harming people
5167,"therefore, taking only gdp as an index of welfare overstates welfare"
5168,"in this case, welfare is much less than indicated by gdp"
5169,(c) change in the distribution of income (gdp) may affect welfare: (i) all people do not earn the same amount of income
5170,"(ii) at the same time, it is also true that in the event of rise in ‘per capita real income’ all are not better off equally"
5171,income of some may rise by less and of some by more than the national average
5172,(iii) it means that the inequality in the distribution of income may increase or decrease
5173,(iv) if it increase it implies that rich become more rich and the poor become more poor
5174,(v) utility of a rupee of income to the poor is more than to the rich
5175,"suppose, the income of the poor declines by one rupee and that of the rich increases by one rupee"
5176,"in such a case, the decline in welfare of the poor will be more than the increase in welfare of the rich"
5177,"(vi) therefore, if the rise in per capita real income inequality increases, it may lead to a decline in welfare (in the macro sense)"
5178,"(d) all products may not contribute equally to economic welfare: (i) gdp includes different types of products, like food articles, houses, clothes, police services, military services, etc"
5179,"(ii) some of these products contribute more to the welfare of the people, like food, clothes, houses, etc"
5180,may comparatively contribute less and may not directly affect the standard of living of the people
5181,"(iii) therefore, how much is the economic welfare would depend more on the types of goods and services produced, and not simply how much is produced"
5182,"(iv) it means that if gdp rises, the increase in welfare may not be in the same proportion"
5183,(e) contribution of some products may be negative: (i) gdp includes all final products whether it is milk or liquor
5184,(ii) milk may provide both immediate and ultimate satisfaction to consumers
5185,"on the other hand, liquor may provide some immediate satisfaction, but because of its harmful effects on health it may lead to decline in welfare"
5186,(iii) gdp include only the monetary values of the products and not their contribution to welfare
5187,"(iv) therefore, economic welfare depends not only on the volume of consumption but also on the type or goods and services consumed"
5188,"methods of national income and how to determine national income by income method and its numericals, steps and precaution: there are three methods of calculating national income"
5189,these are: (a) income method (b) expenditure method (c) value added method/product method/output method national income determination under income method: (a) “production creates income”
5190,"if we want to calculate national income by income method, then we have to add different factor incomes from the economy"
5191,"(b) the addition of all these factor incomes gives us the calculation near by the national income, i.e., net domestic product at fc (ndpfc)"
5192,"compensation of employees (coe)/emoluments of employees: the amount earned by employees from their employers, whether in cash or in kind or through any other social security scheme is known as compensation of employees"
5193,this is broadly divided into the following three components: (a) wages and salaries payable in cash: (i) wages and salaries receivable by the employees in respect of their work
5194,"(iiij cost of travel to and from work, and car parking"
5195,"(iv) bonuses (v) commissions, gratuities, tips, cost of living (i.e., dearness allowance paid in our country) honorarium, vacation, sick leave allowance etc"
5196,(vi) pensions at the time of retirement (deferred wage): pensions at the time of retirement are related to factor services rendered by recipient prior to their retirement
5197,any expenses incurred by the employees and thereafter reimbursed by the business enterprise should be excluded from compensation of employees (coe) as such expenses are part of intermediate consumption of business enterprise
5198,"(b) wages and salaries in kind: remuneration in kind consists of goods and services that are not necessary for work and can be used by employees at their own discretion, for the satisfaction of their needs or wants or those of other members of their households"
5199,it includes: (i) meals and drinks including those consumed when travelling for business
5200,(iii) the services of vehicles or other durables provided for the personal use of the employees
5201,"(iv) goods and services produced as outputs from the employer’s own process of production such as free travel for the employees of railways or airlines, or free coal for miners"
5202,"(v) sports, recreation or holiday facilities for employees and their families"
5203,"(vii) value of the interest foregone by employers when they provide loans to employees at reduced, or even zero rates of interest for the purposes of buying houses, furniture or other goods and services"
5204,it should be kept in mind that it does not include any facilities which are necessary for work and in which employees do not have any discretion
5205,"for example, uniforms or other forms of special clothing to be used for work only"
5206,"examples are uniforms for police, uniforms of drivers, uniforms for nurses in the hospital"
5207,it’s so because such payments are intermediate consumption of business enterprises
5208,"(c) employers’ contribution to social security schemes: employers’ make payments to social security schemes like life insurance, causality insurance, pension schemes etc"
5209,"for example, there is a contributory provident fund scheme for employees of educational institutions and public sector undertakings"
5210,the contribution made by the employers for such schemes is a part of compensation of employees
5211,"the thing which has to be remembered is that, employers’ contribution towards social security scheme should be included whereas employees’ contribution towards social security scheme should not be included as coe is that what the employer pays to employee and if anything borne by employee himself should not be included under coe"
5212,"operating surplus: the cso (central statistical organization) has defined operating surplus as “value of gross output less the sum of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees, mixed income, depreciation and nit.” operating surplus = gvomp – intermediate consumption – coe – mixed income – depreciation – nit in other words, it is the sum of income from property and income from entrepreneurship"
5213,"operating surplus have the following two components: (a) income from property: it is the income which has been arisen from rent, interest and royalty"
5214,it is divided into three components: (i) rent: the income arising from ownership of land and building is known as rent
5215,"if a person living in his own house, then it is assumed in an economy that he is paying rent to himself"
5216,"(ii) royalty: royalties are the payments made for the use of mineral deposits such as coal, oil, etc"
5217,(iii) interest: it is the amount earned for lending funds to the production units
5218,but interest income includes interest on loan taken for productive services only
5219,the following categories of interest should not be included : • interest on national debt or interest paid by government on nation debt should not be included as it is assumed that such interest is paid on loan taken for consumption purpose
5220,• interest paid by one firm to another firm as it is already included in the profit of the firm which pays it
5221,(b) income from entrepreneurship: it is a return of entrepreneur after paying all the other factors of production
5222,it is of the following three types: (i) distributed profit (dividend): it is that part of total profit which is given to shareholders
5223,the thing to be noted here is that profit earned by one firm to another should not be included under this head because it is already included in the profit of the firm which pays it
5224,(ii) undistributed profit (saving of private corporate sector or retained £arnings): it is that part of total profit which is not given to shareholders and kept as a reserve for future uncertainties
5225,(iii) corporation tax (profit tax): it is that part of total profit which is given by a firm to the government as tax
5226,"the concept of operating surplus is applicable to all producing enterprises, whether they belong to the private sector or to the government"
5227,the government enterprises also are expected to earn reasonable rate of profit on the funds invested
5228,"but, operating surplus does not arise in the general government sector as they produce goods and services for the social welfare of the country and not for profit motive i.e., why rent, interest and profit are zero in general government sector"
5229,"mixed income: income of own account workers (like farmers, doctors, barbers, etc.) and unincorporated enterprises (like small shopkeepers, repair shops) is known as mixed income"
5230,"they do not generally hire factor services from the market rather use their own resources like land, labour, funds, etc"
5231,"as the result of, it becomes difficult to classify their income distinctly among rent, wages, interest and profit"
5232,"ndpfc compensation of employees (coe) + operating surplus (os) + mixed income (my) method for calculating national income by income method: if we want to calculate national income by income method, we have to add different factor incomes from the economy"
5233,"the addition of all these factor incomes gives us the calculation near by the national income, i.e"
5234,profit earned by one firm to another should not be included because it is a part of intermediate consumption
5235,"if profit after tax is given and corporate tax is given, then by adding them we get profit"
5236,profit after tax = 1000 corporate tax =100 profit =1100 3
5237,"if profit before tax and corporate tax are given, then ignore corporate tax"
5238,"profit before tax = 1000 corporate tax =100 profit = 1000 steps for calculating national income by income method: step 1: to identify enterprises which employ primary factors (land, labour, capital, enterprise)"
5239,"step 2: to classify various types of factor income like: (a) compensation of employees: the amount earned by employees from their employer, whether in cash or in kind or through any other social security scheme is known as compensation of employees"
5240,(b) operating surplus: it is the sum of income from property and income from entrepreneurship
5241,"(c) mixed income: income of own account workers (like farmers, doctors, barbers, etc.) and unincorporated enterprises (like small shopkeepers, repair shops) is known as mixed income"
5242,step 3: to estimate amount of factor payments made by each producing unit
5243,"step 4: to add all factor incomes / payments within domestic territory to get domestic income, i.e., ndpfc"
5244,"ndpfc = compensation of employees + operating surplus + mixed income step 5: addition of nfia to ndpfc  to get ny, i.e., nnpfc"
5245,"(a) avoid transfers: national income includes only factor payments, i.e., payment for the services rendered to the production units by the owners of factors"
5246,"any payment for which no service is rendered is called a transfer, not a production activity"
5247,since transfers are not a production activity it must not be included in national income
5248,(b) avoid capital gain: capital gain refers to the income from the sale of second hand goods and financial assets
5249,"income from the sale of old cars, old house, bonds, debentures, etc"
5250,"so, any income arising to the owners of such things is not a factor income"
5251,"(c) include income from self-consumed output: when a house owner lives in his house, he does not pay any rent"
5252,"since, rent is a payment for services rendered, even though rendered to the owner itself, it must be counted as a factor payment"
5253,(d) include free services provided by the owners of the production units: owners work in their own unit but do not charge salary
5254,owners do production in their own buildings but do not charge rent
5255,"although they do not charge, yet the services have been performed"
5256,the imputed value of these must be included in national income
5257,"how to determine national income by expenditure method and its numericals, steps and precautions: national income determination by expenditure method: (a) “production creates income, income creates expenditure”"
5258,"if we want to calculate national income by this method, we have to add different final expenditures from an economy"
5259,"(b) the addition of all those final expenditure gives us the calculation near by the national income, i.e"
5260,"government final consumption expenditure (gfce): the expenditure made by a general government on current expenditure on goods and services like public health, defence, law and order, education, etc"
5261,these goods and services generate no income because it is produce by a general government without any profit motive
5262,these goods and services are valued at their cost to the government as they are not sold to the citizen and have been produced for the social welfare of the citizens
5263,"so, gfce = intermediate consumption of government + compensation of employees (wages and salaries in cash and in kind) by government + direct purchases made abroad by government (purchases made by embassies and consulates located in foreign countries) + consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) – sale of goods and services by government"
5264,private final consumption expenditure (pfce): private final consumption expenditure is defined as consumption expenditure by consumer households (household final consumption expenditure) and private npish (non-profit institution serving households) on all types of consumer goods
5265,pfce = household final consumption expenditure + private non-profit institution serving households final consumption expenditure
5266,the value of following items is measured for getting private final consumption expenditure
5267,(a) purchases of currently produced goods and services in the domestic market by consumer households and npish
5268,(b) direct purchases made abroad by resident households are added but direct purchases in domestic market by non-resident households and extra territorial bodies are deducted
5269,pfce = purchases of currently produced goods and services in the domestic market by consumer households and npish households + direct purchases made abroad by resident households – direct purchases in domestic market by non¬resident households
5270,"note: if in the examination problem household final consumption expenditure is not given, it can be calculated as under household final consumption expenditure = personal disposable income – personal (household) saving 3"
5271,gross domestic capital formation or gross investment or investment expenditure: it refers to additions to the physical stock of capital during a period of time
5272,(a) gross domestic fixed capital formation (gdfcf): it is the expenditure incurred on purchase of fixed assets
5273,it is of three types: (i) gross business fixed investment: it is the amount that the business units spend on purchase of newly produced capital goods like plant and equipments
5274,gross business fixed investment is the gross amount spent on newly produced fixed capital goods
5275,"when depreciation is deducted from it, we obtain net business fixed investment"
5276,gross business fixed investment = net business fixed investment + depreciation (ii) gross residential construction investment: this is the amount spent on construction of flats and residential houses
5277,the investment is said to be gross when depreciation is not deducted and net when depreciation is deducted
5278,"(iii) gross public investment: this includes capital formation by government in the form of building of roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, etc"
5279,this investment is called gross when depreciation is not deducted and net when depreciation is subtracted
5280,"(b) change in stock (closing stock – opening stock) or inventory investment: it is the net change in inventories of final goods, finished goods, semi-finished goods and raw material"
5281,"these are included as they represent currently produced goods, which are not included in the current sale of final output"
5282,it is a difference between closing stock and the opening stock of the year
5283,"(c) net acquisition of valuables: these are those high value durable goods like gold, silver, amtiques, etc"
5284,gdcf = gross domestic fixed capital formation (gdfcf) + change in stock (closing stock – opening stock) + net acquisition of valuables or gdcf = gross business fixed investment + gross residential construction + gross public investment + inventory investment + net acquisition of valuables 4
5285,"net export (export – import): it shows the difference between domestic spending on foreign goods (i.e., imports) and foreign spending on domestic goods (i.e., exports)"
5286,"thus, the difference between exports and imports of a country is called net exports"
5287,net exports = export – import gdpmp = government final consumption expenditure + private final consumption expenditure + gross domestic capital formation + net export numerical problems on expenditure method cbse notescbse notes macro economicsncert solutions macro economics
5288,(iii) these two sectors are dependent on each other in the following ways: • producers supply goods and services to the households
5289,• household (as the owners of factors of production) supplies factors of production (or factor services) to the producers
5290,this interdependence can be explained with the help of the diagram given here
5291,"(b) money flow (i) money flow refers to the flow of factor income, as rent, interest, profit and wages from the producing sector to the household sector as monetary rewards for their factor services as shown in the flowchart"
5292,(ii) the households spend their incomes on the goods and services produced by the producing sector
5293,"accordingly, money flows back to the producing sector as household expenditure as shown in the flowchart"
5294,"circular flow of income in two sector model: the following assumptions with regard to a simple economy with only two sector of economics activity are: (i) there are only two sectors in the economy; that is, household and firms"
5295,"as a result we can derive the following, in the case of our simple economy: (i) total production of goods and services by firms = total consumption of goods and services by household sector"
5296,(ii) factor payments by firms = factor incomes of household sector
5297,"(iv) hence, real flows of production and consumption of firms and households = money flows of income and expenditure of firms and households"
5298,phases of circular flow: there are three types of phases of circular flow
5299,(i) production phase: • it deals with the production of goods and services by the producer sector
5300,"• if we study it in term of the quantity of goods and services produced, it is a real flow"
5301,"but, it is a money flow, if we study it in terms of the market value of the goods produced"
5302,"(ii) distribution phase: it means the flow of income in the form of rent, interest, profit and wages, paid by producer sector to the household sector"
5303,this phase deals with expenditure on the purchase of goods and services by households and other sectors
5304,• this is a money flow from other sectors to the producer sector
5305,factor income (a) income earned by factor of production by rendering their productive services in the production process is known as factor income
5306,(c) it is included in national income as it contribute something in the flow of goods and services
5307,transfer income (a) income received without rendering any productive services is known as transfer income
5308,(c) it is not included in national income as it does not contribute anything in the flow of goods and services
5309,there are two types of transfers: (i) current transfers (ii) capital transfers (i) current transfers • transfers made from the income of the payer and added to the income of the recipient (who receive) for consumption expenditure are called current transfers
5310,"(ii) capital transfers • capital transfers are defined as transfers in cash and in kind for the purpose of investment to recipients, made out of the wealth or saving of the donor"
5311,stock (a) any economic variable which is calculated at a particular point of time is known as stock
5312,"(b) it is static in nature, i.e., it do not change"
5313,"for example, distance, amount of money, money supply, water in tank, etc"
5314,flow (a) any economic variable which is calculated during a period of time is known as flow
5315,"(b) it is dynamic in nature, i.e., it can be changed"
5316,"for example, speed, spending of money, water in river, exports, imports, etc"
5317,"economic territory or domestic territory: (a) according to the united nations, economic territory is the geographical territory administered by a government within which persons, goods and capital circulate freely"
5318,"(b) the above definition is based on the criterion “freedom of circulation of persons, goods and capital”"
5319,"clearly, those parts of the political frontiers (or boundaries) of a country where the government of that country does not enjoy the above “freedom” are not to be included in economic territory of that country"
5320,government of india does not enjoy the above freedom in the foreign embassies located within india
5321,"so, these are not treated as a part of economic territory of india"
5322,they are treated as part of the economic territories of their respective countries
5323,embassy in india is a part of economic territory of the u.s.a
5324,"similarly, the indian embassy in washington is a part of economic territory of india"
5325,"(iii) in layman terms, the domestic territory of a nation is understood to be the territory lying within the political frontiers (or boundaries) of a country"
5326,"but in national income accounting, the term domestic territory is used in a wider sense"
5327,"based on ‘freedom’ criterion, the scope of economic territory is defined to cover: • ships and aircrafts owned and operated by normal residents between two or more countries"
5328,"for example, indian ships moving between china and india i regularly are part of domestic territory of india"
5329,"similarly, planes operated by air india between russia and japan are part of the domestic territory of india"
5330,"similarly, planes operated by malaysian airlines between india and japan are a part of the domestic territory of malaysia"
5331,"• fishing vessels, oil and natural gas rigs and floating platforms operated by the residents of a country in the international waters where they have exclusive rights of operation"
5332,"for example, fishing boats operated by indian fishermen in international waters of indian ocean will be considered a part of domestic territory of india"
5333,"• embassies, consulates and military establishments of a country located abroad"
5334,"for example, indian embassy in russia is a part of the domestic territory of india"
5335,‘consulate’ is an office or building used by consul (an officer commissioned by the government to reside in a foreign country to promote the interest of the countiy to which he belongs)
5336,citizenship/nationalship (a) citizenship is basically a legal concept based on the place of birth of the person or some legal provisions allowing a person to become a citizen
5337,"(b) it means, indian citizenship can arise in two ways: (i) when a person is born in india, he acquires automatic citizenship of india"
5338,(ii) a person born outside india applies for citizenship and indian law allows him to become indian citizen
5339,"normal resident/resident (a) a normal residenf, whether a person or an institution, is one whose centre of economic interest lies in the economic territory of the country in which he lives"
5340,"(b) the centre of economic interest implies in two things: (i) the resident lives or is located within the economic territory for more than one year and (ii) the resident carries out the basic economic activities of earnings, spending and accumulation from that location (c) there is a difference between the terms normal resident (resident) and citizen (or national)"
5341,(i) a person becomes a national of a countiy because he was born in the country or on the basis of some other legal criterion
5342,(ii) a person is treated resident of a country on the basis of economic criterion
5343,(iii) it is not necessary that a resident must also be the national of that country
5344,even foreigners can be the residents if they pass the above stated economic criterion
5345,"for example, a large number of indian nationals have settled in u.s.a., england, australia, etc"
5346,"for india, they are non-resident indians (nri) but continue to remain indian nationals"
5347,"following are not included under the category of normal residents: (i) foreign visitors in the country for such purposes as recreation, holidays, medical treatment, study tours, conferences, sports events, business etc"
5348,(they are supposed to stay in the host country for less than one year
5349,"in case they continue to stay for one year or more in the host country, they will be treated as normal residents of the host countiy)"
5350,"(ii) crew members of foreign vessels, commercial travelers and seasonal workers in , the country (foreign workers who work part of the year in the country in response to the varying seasonal demand for labour and return to their households and border workers who regularly cross the frontier each day or somewhat less regularly, (i.e"
5351,each week) to work in the neighbouring country are the normal residents of their own countries
5352,"(iii) officials, diplomats and members of the armed forces of a foreign country"
5353,"(iv) international bodies like world bank, world health organisation or international monetary fund are not considered residents of the country in which these organisations operate but are treated as residents of international territory"
5354,"however, the staffs of these bodies are treated as normal residents of the country in which the international body operates"
5355,"for example, international body like world health organisation located in india is not normal resident of india but americans working in its office for more than a year will be treated as normal residents of india"
5356,(v) foreigners who are the employees of non-resident enterprises and who have come to the country for purposes of installing machinery or equipment purchased from their employers
5357,"in case they continue to stay for one year or more, they will be treated as normal residents of the host country)"
5358,"final goods (a) these are the goods that are used for: (i) personal consumption (like bread purchased by consumer household), or (if) investment or capital formation (like building, machinery purchased by a firm) (b) in other words, final goods are those, which require no further processing and are available in an economy for consumption purpose or investment"
5359,"(c) according to production boundary, if a good crosses the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to final consumer or investment made by a producer within the imaginary line of production unit is known as the final good"
5360,intermediate goods (a) these are the goods that are used for: (i) further processing (like sugar used for making sweets); or (ii) resale in the same year (if car purchased by car dealer for resale)
5361,"(b) in other words, intermediate goods are the ones, which require further processing and are not available in an economy for the purpose of consumption"
5362,"(c) according to the production boundary, if a good does not cross the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to other firm within the production boundary, is known as intermediate good"
5363,"point to remember for final goods and intermediate goods (a) basis of classification: if a good is used for: (i) personal consumption; or (ii) investment then it is a final good, whereas, if a good is used for: (i) further processing; or (ii) resale in the same year, then it is known as intermediate good"
5364,"thus, the basis of classification between these two goods is not the commodity itself, but the use made of it"
5365,"for example, bread used by a consumer household is a final goods, but the same used by a bakery for making a sandwich is a intermediate goods"
5366,(b) production boundary (i) production boundary plays a vital role to differentiate between intermediate and final goods
5367,the production boundary is the imaginary line around the production unit
5368,"(ii) according to the production boundary, if a good crosses the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to final consumer or investment made by a producer within the imaginary line of production unit, it is known as final good"
5369,"as against it, if a good does not cross the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to other firm within the production boundary, it is known as intermediate good"
5370,the thick border drawn around these three units is the production boundary
5371,bread is final good as it lies outside the purview of production boundary
5372,"important points about intermediate goods: as far as intermediate consumption of general government is concerned, it’s purchased goods ranges from ordinary writing paper, pencils and pens to sophisticated fighter aircrafts"
5373,the goods and services purchased include both durable goods and non-durable goods and services
5374,"the intermediate consumption of the general government includes the following items: (a) value of all non-durable goods and services such as petrol, electricity, lubricants, stationery, soaps, towels etc"
5375,including repair and maintenance of capital stock: non-durable goods and services are those which have an expected life time of use of less than one year
5376,repair and maintenance of capital stock mean expenditure incurred for maintaining fixed assets and keep them in good working order
5377,this includes the expenditure on new parts of the fixed assets
5378,the life of the new parts may be around one year or slightly more and the value should be relatively small
5379,"for example, replacement of the tyres of a truck is an intermediate consumption, but not the replacement of its engine"
5380,"(b) expenditure on military equipment missiles, rockets, bombs, warships, submarines, military aircrafts, tanks, missile carriers and rocket-launchers etc"
5381,(c) value of goods received from foreign governments in form of gifts or as transfers
5382,"examples of these transfers in kind are food, clothing, medicines, vegetable oils, butter, toys sent by the government of one country to the other in times of natural calamities or as a token of goodwill and friendship between two countries"
5383,"however, the goods received for distribution to consumer households without renovation or alternation should not be included in intermediate consumption as these goods go into the final consumption of consumer households"
5384,"(d) as we know, intermediate goods are purchased by one production unit from another production unit within the production boundary"
5385,"however, it’s not necessary that all purchases by one production unit from other production units are intermediate purchases"
5386,are not intermediate purchases (if they are not meant for resale in the same year)
5387,"rather, these purchases are meant for investment and are termed as final product"
5388,in research and exploratory activities (like oil exploration in different parts of india by the oil and natural gas commission) or improving the technology of a particular production process
5389,"• advertisements, market research and public relationship meant for improving the goodwill of the business enterprises"
5390,final goods can be classified into two groups: consumption goods and capital goods
5391,(a) consumption goods: (i) meaning: consumption goods are those which satisfy the wants of the consumers directly
5392,(u) categories of consumption goods: • durable goods: these goods have an expected life time of several years and of relatively high value
5393,"they are motor cars, refrigerators, television sets, washing machines, air-conditioners, kitchen equipments, computers, communication equipments etc"
5394,• semi-durable goods: these goods have an expected life time of use of one year or slightly more
5395,"examples are clothing, furniture, electrical appliances like fans, electric irons, hot plates and crockery"
5396,"• non-durable goods: goods which can not be used again and again, i.e., they lose their identity in a single act of consumption are known as non-durable goods"
5397,"these are foodgrains, milk and milk products, edible oils, beverages, vegetables, tobacco and other food articles"
5398,• services: services are non-material goods which satisfy the human wants directly
5399,"they cannot be seen or touched, i.e., they are intangible in nature"
5400,"these are medical care, transport and communications, education, domestic services rendered by hired servants, etc"
5401,(b) capital goods: (i) capital goods are defined as all goods produced for use in future productive processes
5402,"for example, all the durable goods like cars, trucks, refrigerators, buildings, aircrafts, air-fields and submarines used to produce goods and are ready for sale in the market are a part of capital goods"
5403,"(ii) stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods lying with the producers at the end of an accounting year are also a part of capital goods"
5404,"(iii) some more examples of capital goods are machinery, equipment, roads and bridges"
5405,(iv) these goods require repair or replacement over time as their value depreciate over a period of time
5406,differentiate between final goods and intermediate goods on the basis of end used classification of goods and services with example
5407,circular flow of income: it refers to flow of money income or the flow of goods and services across different sectors of the economy in a circular form
5408,"money flow (nominal flow): money flow refers to the flow of factor income, as rent, interest, profit and wages from the producing sector to the household sector as monetary rewards for their factor services"
5409,real flow or physical flow: real flow of income implies the flow of factor services from the household sector to the producing sector and corresponding flow of goods and services from the producing sector to the household sector
5410,factor income: income earned by factor of production by rendering their productive services in the production process is known as factor income
5411,transfer income: income received without rendering any productive services is known as transfer income
5412,current transfers: transfers made from the current income of the payer and added to the current income of the recipient (who receive) for consumption expenditure are called current transfers
5413,capital transfers: capital transfers are defined as transfers in cash and in kind for the purpose of investment to recipient made out of the wealth or saving of a donor
5414,"final goods: these are those which are used for: (a) personal consumption (like bread purchased by consumer household), or (b) investment or capital formation (like building, machinery purchased by a firm) 9"
5415,"intermediate goods: these are those, which are used for: (a) further processing (like sugar used for making sweets), or (b) resale in the same year (if car purchased by a car dealer for resale)"
5416,consumption goods: consumption goods are those goods which satisfy the wants of consumers directly
5417,capital goods: capital goods are defined as all goods produced for use in future productive processes
5418,"(a)primary function or main function: primary function includes the most important functions of money, which it must perform in an economic system irrespective of time and place"
5419,"(i) medium of exchange • money when used as a medium of exchange helps to eliminate the basic limitation of barter trade, that is, the lack of double coincidence of wants"
5420,• individuals can exchange their goods and services for money and then can use this money to buy other goods and services according to their needs and convenience
5421,"• thus, the process of exchange shall have two parts: a sale and a purchase"
5422,• the ease at which money is converted into other goods and services is called “liquidity of money”
5423,(ii) measure of value /unit of account • another important function of money is that it serves as a common measure of value or a unit of account
5424,• under barter economy there was no common measure of value in which the values of different goods could be measured and compared with each other
5425,"• as geoffrey crowther puts it, “money acts as a standard measure of value to which all other things can be compared.” money measures the value of economic goods"
5426,• money works as a common denominator into which the values of all goods and services are expressed
5427,"• when we express the values of a commodity in terms of money, it is called price and by knowing prices of the various commodities, it is easy to calculate exchange ratios between them"
5428,(b) secondary functions (i) standard of deferred payments • credit has become the life and blood of a modern capitalist economy
5429,• the debtors make a promise that they will make payments on some future date
5430,in those situations money acts as a standard of deferred payments
5431,"• it has become possible because money has general acceptability, its value is stable, it is durable and homogeneous"
5432,(ii) store of vaiue • wealth can be conveniently stored in the form of money
5433,• savings are secured and can be used whenever there is a need
5434,"• in this way, money acts as a bridge between the present and the future"
5435,characteristics or features of money: (a) durability: money must be durable and not likely to deteriorate rapidly with frequent handling
5436,currency notes and coins are being used repeatedly and shall continue to do so for many years
5437,(b) medium of exchange: money is the thing that acts as a medium of exchange for the sale and purchase of goods and services
5438,paper money is better than metal coins because it is light in weight
5439,(d) measure of value: it not only serves as medium of exchange but also acts as a measure of value
5440,the value of all the goods and services is expressed in terms of money
5441,money has overcome the drawbacks of barter system: barter system makes the exchange process very difficult and highly inefficient
5442,"money has overcome the drawbacks of barter system in the following manners: (a) medium of exchange (i) under barter system, there is lack of double coincidence of wants"
5443,(ii) with money as a medium exchange individuals can exchange their goods and services for money and then use this money to buy other goods and services according to their needs and conveniences
5444,(iii) a buyer can buy goods through money and a seller can sell goods for money
5445,"(b) measure of value (i) under barter system, there was no common measure of value"
5446,"(ii) as geoffrey crowther puts it, “money acts as a standard measure of value to which all other things can be compared.” money measures the value of economic goods"
5447,(iii) money works as a common denominator into which the values of all goods and services are expressed
5448,"(iv) when we express the values of a commodity in terms of money, it is called price and by knowing prices of the various commodities, it is easy to calculate exchange ratios between them"
5449,(c) store of value (i) under barter system it is very difficult to store wealth for future use
5450,(ii) most of the goods are perishable and their storage requires huge space and transportation cost
5451,(iii) wealth can be conveniently stored in the form of money
5452,"(d) standard of deferred payments (i) under barter system, transactions on deferred payments are not possible"
5453,"(ii) with money, the debtors make a promise that they will make payments on some future dates"
5454,in these situations money acts as a standard of deferred payments
5455,"(iii) it has become possible because money has general acceptability, its value is stable, it is durable and homogeneous"
5456,"legal definition of money: (a) legally, money is anything proclaimed by law as a medium of exchange"
5457,(b) paper notes and coins (together called currency) is money as a matter of law
5458,it means people have to accept it legally for different payments
5459,currency is also called fiat money because it commands ‘fiat’ (order/authority) of the government
5460,"functional definition of money: functional definition of money refers to money as anything that performs four basic functions, (a) it serves as a medium of exchange"
5461,(c) it serves as a means for future / contractual payments or standard of deferred payments
5462,"according to this, definition of money includes both notes and coins as well as chequeable deposits with the banks"
5463,narrow definition of money: functional definition of money is a narrow definition of money
5464,"in other words, in its narrow definition, money includes only those things that function as money in terms of: (a) medium of exchange"
5465,broad definition of money: (a) a broad definition of money also includes time deposits/term deposits with the banks or post offices as a component of money
5466,"(b) these deposits can be converted into demand deposits on a short notice, and are “near money assets”"
5467,money assets and near money assets together make up a definition of money
5468,"money supply: the volume of money held by the public at a point of time, in an economy, is referred to as the money supply"
5469,"measures of money supply: on the recommendation of the second working group on money supply, the rbi presented four measures of money supply in its 1977 issues of rbi bulletin, namely m1, m2, m3 and m4"
5470,measures of m1 include: (a) currency notes and coins with the public (excluding cash in hand of all commercial banks) [c] (b) demand deposits of all commercial and co-operative banks excluding inter-bank deposits
5471,"(dd), where demand deposits are those deposits which can be withdrawn by the depositor at any time by means of cheque"
5472,"(c) other deposits with rbi [o.d] m1 = c + dd + od where, other deposits are the deposits held by the rbi of all economic units except the government and banks"
5473,"od includes demand deposits of semi¬government public financial institutions (like idbi, ifci, etc.), foreign central banks and governments, the international monetary fund, the world bank, etc"
5474,measures of m2: (i) m1 [c + dd + od] (if) post office saving deposits measures of m3: (i) m1 (ii) time deposits of all commercial and co-operative banks
5475,"where, time deposits are the deposits that cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the stipulated time for which deposits are made"
5476,measures of m4: (i) m3 (ii) total deposits with the post office saving organization (excluding national savings certificates)
5477,high-powered money: high-powered money is money produced by the rbi and the government
5478,it consists of two things: (a) currency held by the public and (b) cash reserves with the banks
5479,barter system: barter system of exchange is a system in which goods are exchanged for goods
5480,double coincidence of wants: it means that goods in possession of two different persons must be useful and needed by each other
5481,money: money is something which is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and can be converted into other assets without loosing its time and value
5482,"legal definition of money: legally, money is anything proclaimed by law as a medium of exchange"
5483,paper notes and coins (together called currency) is money as a matter of law
5484,fiat money: it is defined as a money which is under the ‘fiat’ (order/authority) of the government to act as a money
5485,functional definition of money: functional definition of money refers to money as anything that performs four basic functions
5486,"(medium of exchange, standard unit of value, standard of deferred payments, store of value) 7"
5487,narrow definition of money: functional definition of money is a narrow definition of money
5488,broad definition of money: a broad definition of money also includes time deposits/ term deposits with the banks or post offices as a component of money
5489,"money supply: the stock of money held by the public at a point of time, in an economy, is referred to as the money supply"
5490,high-powered money: it is money produced by the rbi and the government
5491,it consists of two things: (i) currency held by the public and (ii) cash reserves with the banks
5492,demand deposits: these are the deposits that can be withdrawn by the depositor at any time by means of cheque
5493,time deposits: these are the deposits that cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the stipulated time for which deposits are made
5494,other deposit measures of m1: other deposits are the deposits held by the rbi of all economic units except the government and banks
5495,"od includes demand deposits of semi-government public financial institutions (like idbi, ifci, etc.), foreign central banks and governments, the international monetary fund, the world bank, etc"
5496,"in figure a at point p, income is equal to consumption, which is known as to be breakeven point"
5497,"corresponding to point p, we derive point p1; in figure b, where saving is equal to zero"
5498,"in figure a, the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e, where aggregate supply = aggregate demand"
5499,"corresponding to point e, we derive the point e1, where saving = investment"
5500,"determination of equilibrium level of national income through aggregate demand-aggregate supply approach (a) it refers to the point that has come to be established under the given condition of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and has tendency to stick to that level under this given condition where aggregate demand = aggregate supply"
5501,"(b) if due to some disturbance, we divert from that position, the economic forces will work in such a manner so as to drive us back to the original position, i.e., aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply"
5502,"(c) in the above mentioned figure, at point p, income = consumption, which is known as to be a break-even point"
5503,"the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e, where aggregate demand = aggregate supply"
5504,"(d) if due to some disturbance we divert from our position, like when ad > as [at y2], then, production will have to be increased to meet the excess demand"
5505,"as we know positive relationship exists between national income and consumption, so consumption will increase, which will thereby increase the aggregate demand till we reach the equilibrium"
5506,"(e) as against it, when ad < as [at y1], then there would be stockpiling and producers  will produce less"
5507,"national income will fall and as a result consumption will start falling, which will thereby fall the aggregate demand till we reach the equilibrium"
5508,(a) ex-ante saving and ex-ante investment: (i) in an economy what we plan (or intend or desire) to save during a particular period is called ex-ante saving
5509,"(ii) against it, what we plan (or intend or desire) to invest during a particular period is called ex-ante investment"
5510,(i) in an economy what we actually save or what is left after deducting consumption expenditure from income is called ex-post (or realized) saving
5511,(ii) as against it what we actually invest or what we actually add to the physical assets of an economy is called ex-post (or realized) investment
5512,"ad = as consumption (c) + investment (i) = consumption (c) + saving (s) i = s (b) if due to some disturbance, we divert from that position, the economic forces will work in such a manner so as to drive us back to the original position, i.e., saving is equal to investment"
5513,"(c) in the above figure, the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e, where saving = investment which is derived from a point where ad = as"
5514,"(d) if due to some disturbance we divert from our position like when investment > saving [at y2], then production will have to be increased to meet the excess demand"
5515,"consequently, national income will increase leading to rise in saving until saving becomes equal to investment"
5516,it is here that equilibrium level of income is established because what the savers intend to save becomes equal to what the investors intend to invest
5517,"(e) as against it, when saving > investment [at y1], then there would be stockpiling and producers will produce less"
5518,.national income will fall and as a result saving will start falling until it becomes equal to investment
5519,"effective demand: the level at which the economy is in equilibrium, i.e., where aggregate demand = aggregate supply, is called effective demand"
5520,"it can also be explained with the help of the following table: paradox of thrift, it’s reasons with numirical example 1"
5521,the term thrift means savings and the paradox of thrift shows how an attempt by the economy as a whole to save more out of its current income will ultimately results in lower savings for the economy
5522,"if all the people in the economy make an effort to save more, then the total savings of the community will not increase, on the contrary they will decrease"
5523,reasons for “paradox of thrift” to operate (a) as we know that one person’s expenditure is another person’s income
5524,"(b) if individual ‘a’ decides to save more by reducing his consumption expenditure, the income of individual ‘b’ will be less and individual ‘b’ in turn will spend less"
5525,"(c) thus, if all individuals in the economy decide to save more, the income received by each individual will be less and overall income will fall and also lower will be the total savings"
5526,"diagram representation: the concept of paradox of thrift with the help of diagrams and mathematical illustration is as under: when investment is autonomous when investment is induced (a) paradox of thrift fails in keyne’s theory (when investment is autonomous): in figure a, society, households plan to save more at each income level"
5527,"equilibrium national income falls from y to yr the thing which has to be remembered is that savings is equal to autonomous investment, that is, remains unchanged"
5528,"(b) paradox of thrift is possible when investment is induced: in figure b, we have induced investment function which makes the investment curve upward positively sloping"
5529,"with the increase in savings, not only the equilibrium income falls, but also savings decline"
5530,"numerical illustration: suppose the original savings function is given as, s = -50 + 0.5y and investment (i) = 25 + 0.25y"
5531,equilibrium level of income will be attained at the level where saving = investment
5532,"25y = 75 y = 300 therefore, savings at y=300 will be s = -50 + 0.5 (300) = 100 suppose, eveiy individual in the economy decides to save 25 more at each level of income"
5533,the new savings function will be s2 = -50 + 25 + 0.5y – -25 + 0.5y
5534,"the new equilibrium income will be attained at the level where s2 = i -25 + 0.5y = 25 + 0.25y 0.25y = 50 y = 200 therefore, savings at y = 200 will be s = -25 + 0.5 (200) = -25 + 100 = 75 thus, when everybody in the economy decides to save more, the equilibrium level of income falls and the total savings also fall"
5535,"elements in understanding investment (marginal efficiency of investment and market rate of interest), investment demand function 1"
5536,elements in understanding investment: a private investor’s demand for investment depends on two things: (a) the rate of return on investment or m.e.i: the expected rate of return from’an additional unit of investment is called marginal efficiency of investment (m.e.i)
5537,it is defined as the expected rate of return of an additional unit of capital goods
5538,(i) supply price: the cost of replacing the machine under consideration with a brand new machine is known its supply price
5539,"for example, if a machine of rs.1 lakh is replaced in place of old machine, then rs"
5540,(ii) prospective yields: it refers to expected net returns(of all costs) from the capital asset over its lifetime
5541,"for example, if the given machine is expected to yield revenue of rs"
5542,"10,000 and running expenditure is rs.2000, the prospective yield will be, 10000 – 2000 = 8000"
5543,"(iii) formula of marginal efficiency of investment: in the given examples, marginal efficiency of investment will be, (b) the market rate of interest: it refers to cost of funds borrowed for financing the investment"
5544,there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
5545,(c) decision whether to invest or not (i) the investor goes on making additional investments until m.e.i becomes equal to the rate of interest
5546,"if m.e.i is greater than the rate of interest, the investors has to increase the investment and if the rate is higher than the m.e.i, no investment is to be made"
5547,"(ii) for example, if an entrepreneur has to pay 15% market rate of interest on the loan taken by him and he expected rate of profit i.e., m.e.i"
5548,"is 30%, then he will surely go for the investment and will continue making investment till m.e.i"
5549,investment demand function: investment demand function is the relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
5550,there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
5551,investment multiplier meaning: the ratio of change in national income (δy) due to a change in investment (δi) is known as multiplier (k)
5552,ex-ante saving: in an economy what we plan (or intend or desire) to save during a particular period is called ex-ante saving
5553,"ex-ante investment: in an economy, what we plan (or intend or desire) to invest during a particular period is called ex-ante investment"
5554,expost saving: in an economy what we actually save or what is left after deducting consumption expenditure from income is called ex-post (or realized) saving
5555,"expost investment: in an economy, what we actually invest or what we actually add to the physical assets of an economy is called ex-post (or realized) investment"
5556,"effective demand: the level at which the economy is in equilibrium, i.e., where aggregate demand = aggregate supply, is called effective demand"
5557,paradox of thrift: the term thrift means savings and the paradox of thrift shows how an attempt by the economy as a whole to save more out of its current income will ultimately results in lower savings for the economy
5558,marginal efficiency of investment: the expected rate of return from an additional unit of investment is called marginal efficiency of investment (m.e.i)
5559,"in other words, it is the expected rate of return of an additional unit of capital goods"
5560,supply price: the cost of replacing the machine under consideration with a brand new machine is known its supply price
5561,prospective yields: it refers to expected net returns (of all costs) from the capital asset over its lifetime
5562,market rate of interest: it refers to cost of funds borrowed for financing the investment
5563,there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand

5683,the cycle of violence continued nearly for a decade and peace returned to punjab by the middle of 1990s
5684,"the alliance of akali dal (badal) and the bjp scored a major victory in 1997, in the first normal elections in the state in the post militancy era"
5685,"the north-east the north-east region of the country now consists of seven states, also referred to as the ‘seven sister.’ the region witnessed a lot of change in 1947"
5686,the vast international border and weak communication between the north-east and the rest of india have added to the delicate nature of politics there
5687,"three issues dominate the politics of north¬east: demands for autonomy, movements for secession and opposition to ‘outsiders,’ demands for autonomy at the time of independence the entire region except manipur and tripura comprised the state of assam"
5688,there were opposition and protest riots throughout the state on various issues
5689,"at different points of time the central government had to create meghalaya, mizoram and arunachal pradesh out of assam"
5690,secessionist movements for autonomy there were secessionist movements in north-east region like mizoram and nagaland etc
5691,"after independence, the mizo hills area was made an autonomous district within assam"
5692,movement for secession gained popular support after the assam government ‘failed to respond adequately to great famine of 1959 in mizo hills.’ mizo’s anger led to formation of mizo national front (mnf) under the leadership of laldenga
5693,"mnf fought guerilla war, got support from pakistani government and secured shelter in east pakistan"
5694,in 1986 a peace agreement was signed between rajiv gandhi and laldenga
5695,"this accord granted mizoram as full fledged statehood with special powers, and mnf agreed to give up secessionist struggle"
5696,"thus, the accord turn mizoram as one of the most peaceful places in the region"
5697,the story of nagaland is similar to mizoram except that started much earlier and had not yet such a happy ending
5698,after a section of violent insurgency a section of the nagas signed an agreement with the government of india but it was not acceptable to other rebels
5699,movements against outsiders the large scale migration into the north-east gave rise to a special kind of problem that pitted the ‘local’ communities against people who were seen as ‘outsiders’ or migrants
5700,the issue has taken political and sometimes violent form in many states of north- east
5701,the assam movement from 1979 to 1985 is the best example of such movements against ‘outsiders’
5702,"in 1979, the all assam students’ union (aasu), a students’ group not affiliated to any party, led an anti-foreigner movement"
5703,"movement demanded, outsiders who had entered the state after 1951 should be sent back"

5705,"in 1975, sikkim was merged with india and it became the 22nd state of the indian union"
5706,accommodation and national integration regional aspirations are very much a part of democratic politics
5707,expression of regional issues is not an aberration or an abnormal phenomenon
5708,the best way to respond to regional aspirations is through democratic negotiations rather than through suppression
5709,regional imbalance in economic development contributes to the feeling of regional discrimination
5710,"goa’s liberation after independence 1947, british withdrew but portuguese who were ruling since 16th century in goa, daman and diu refused to withdraw themselves"
5711,goa was liberated in 1961 from portuguese by an army operation
5712,1980s may be seen as a period of rising regional aspirations creating various regional movements which conclude in a negotiated settlement or accords between the government’s groups
5713,indian approach maintained a balance in the principles of unity and diversity even by redrawing the internal boundaries of country in response to preserve the culture of different regions and linguistic groups
5714,"immediately after independence, india had to cope up with the issues of partition, displacement, integration of princely states and reorganisation of states i.e"
5715,"jammu and kashmir issues political aspiration, north-east had no consensus to be a part of india and dravidian movement briefly toyed with the idea of separate country"
5716,"jammu and kashmir comprised of three social and political regions namely kashmir, jammu and ladakh region"
5717,"on the issue of regional autonomy, accession was promised on reference of people"
5718,"special federal status guaranteed by article 370, to protect regional autonomy"
5719,"during most of the period between 1953 to 1974, congress exercised a lot of influence on the politics of jammu and kashmir"
5720,"except it, from 1989, separatist politics was also surfaced in kashmir with the stronger demand for intrastate autonomy rather than state autonomy"
5721,"in present scenario, most of separatist in dialogue are trying to re-negotiate a relationship of the state with india"
5722,"in punjab, anandpur sahib resolution was passed at the conference of akali dal at anandpur sahib in 1973 to ascertain regional autonomy and to redefine centre-state relationship"
5723,it had a limited appeal and akali government was dismissed in 1980
5724,"afterwards, the movement launched by akali dal took the form of armed insurgency and resolution became controversial"
5725,"in 1985, punjab accord was signed between rajiv gandhi and harchand singh longowal, president of akali dal to transfer chandigarh, appointment of a commission to resolve border dispute and agreement for compensation to better treatment"
5726,"but peace did not come easily, violence led many excesses and fragmentation of akali dal"
5727,"in 1997, first normal elections in punjab were held in post militancy era and alliance of akali dal and bjp scored a major victory"
5728,the north-east region consisted of seven states referred to as ‘seven sisters’
5729,the reorganisation of north-east was complete by 1972 but did not end the autonomy demands i.e
5730,"bodos, karbis, dimasas demanded separate state in assam and issues were resolved with the grant of some autonomy to these issues"
5731,even ‘assam accord’ was signed over the issue of‘outsiders’ in assam in 1985
5732,"the assam movement was combination of cultural pride and economic backwardness as it was against outsiders to maintain cultural integration and poverty, unemployment also existed despite natural resources like oil, tea and coal"
5733,regional aspirations range from demands of statehood and economic development to autonomy and separation were coming up which taught many lessons to us i.e
5734,"expression of regional issues is not abnormal phenomenon, to respond through democratic negotiations, power sharing among groups and parties, economic development of region and flexible federal system"
5735,"goa was under the portuguese along with daman and diu, which expected freedom in 1947 but portuguese refused"
5736,goa wanted to be merged with motherland and suppressed from religious conversions and civil rights known as ‘goa problem’

5746,it can also be explained with the help of the following formula: 3
5747,"banks required to keep only a fraction of deposits as cash reserves banks are required to keep only a fraction of deposits as cash reserves because of the following two reasons: (a) first, the banking experience has revealed that not all depositors approach the banks for withdrawal of money at the same time and also that normally they withdraw a fraction of deposits"
5748,"(b) secondly, there is a constant flow of new deposits into the banks"
5749,"therefore to meet the daily demand for withdrawal of cash, it is sufficient for banks to keep only a fraction of deposits as a cash reserve"
5750,"when the primary cash deposit in the banking system leads to multiple expansion in the total deposits, it is known as money multiplier or credit multiplier"
5751,the central bank is the apex institution of a country’s monetary system
5752,the design and the control of the country’s monetary policy is its main responsibility
5753,(a) currency authority: (i) the central bank has the sole monopoly to issue currency notes
5754,currency notes issued by the central bank are the legal tender money
5755,"(ii) legal tender money is one, which every individual is bound to accept by law in exchange for goods and services and in the discharge of debts"
5756,"(iii) central bank has an issue department, which is solely responsible for the issue of notes"
5757,"(iv) however, the monopoly of central bank to issue the currency notes may be partial in certain countries"
5758,"(v) for example, in india, one rupee notes and all types of coins are issued by the government and all other notes are issued by the reserve bank of india"
5759,"(b) banker, agent and advisor to the government: central bank everywhere in the world acts as banker, fiscal agent and adviser to their respective government"
5760,"(i) as banker: as a banker to the government, the central bank performs same functions as performed by the commercial banks to their customers"
5761,• it receives deposits from the government and collects cheques and drafts deposited in the government account
5762,• it provides cash to the government as resumed for payment of salaries and wages to their staff and other cash disbursements
5763,• it supplies foreign exchange to the government for repaying external debt or making other payments
5764,"(ii) as fiscal agent: as a fiscal agent, it performs the following functions : • it manages the public debt"
5765,• it collects taxes and other payments on behalf of the government
5766,"• it represents the government in the international financial institutions (such as world bank, international monetary fund, etc.) and conferences"
5767,(iii) as adviser • the central bank also acts as the financial adviser to the government
5768,"• it gives advice to the government on all financial and economic matters such as deficit financing, devaluation of currency, trade policy, foreign exchange policy, etc"
5769,banker’s bank and supervisor: (a) banker’s bank: central bank acts as the banker to the banks in three ways: (i) custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks; (ii) as the lender of the last resort; and (iii) as clearing agent
5770,"(i) as a custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks, the central bank maintains the cash reserves of the commercial banks"
5771,every commercial bank has to keep a certain percent of its cash reserves with the central bank by law
5772,"• as banker to the banks, the central bank acts as the lender of the last resort"
5773,"• in other words, in case the commercial banks fail to meet their financial requirements from other sources, they can, as a last resort, approach to the central bank for loans and advances"
5774,• the central bank assists such banks through discounting of approved securities and bills of exchange
5775,"(ii) as clearing agent • since it is the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks, the central bank can act as the clearinghouse for these banks"
5776,"• since all banks have their accounts with the central bank, the central bank can easily settle the claims of various banks against each other simply by book entries of transfers from and to their accounts"
5777,• this method of settling accounts is called clearing house function of the central bank
5778,"(b) supervisor (i) the central bank supervises, regulate and control the commercial banks"
5779,"(ii) the regulation of banks may be related to their licensing, branch expansion, liquidity of assets, management, amalgamation (merging of banks) and liquidation (the winding of banks)"
5780,(iii) the control is exercised by periodic inspection of banks and the returns filed by them
5781,controller of money supply and credit: principal instruments of monetary policy or credit control of the central bank of a country are broadly classified as: (a) quantitative instruments or general tools; and (b) qualitative instruments or selective tools
5782,(a) quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy: these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of money/credit in the economy
5783,these instruments do not direct or restrict the flow of credit to some specific sectors of the economy
5784,they are as under: (i) bank rate (discount rate) • bank rate is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral (security for purpose of loan)
5785,"the thing, which has to be remembered, is that central bank lends to commercial banks and not to general public"
5786,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, -> central bank raises bank rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank"
5787,"-> it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans, which discourages investment"
5788,-> again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
5789,"-> thus, expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced, which will control the excess demand"
5790,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, -> central bank decreases bank rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank"
5791,"-> decrease in bank rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates, which encourages borrowers from taking loans, which encourages investment"
5792,-> again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
5793,"-> thus, expenditure on investment and consumption increase, which will control the deficient demand"
5794,(ii) repo rate • repo rate is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
5795,• these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
5796,• it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price
5797,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, -> central bank raises repo rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank"
5798,"-> it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans, which discourages investment"
5799,-> again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
5800,"-> thus, expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced, which will control the excess demand"
5801,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, -> central bank decreases repo rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank"
5802,"-> decrease in repo rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates, which encourages borrowers from taking loans, which encourages investment"
5803,-> again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
5804,"-> thus, expenditure on investment and consumption increase, which will control the deficient demand"
5805,(iii) reverse repo rate • it is the rate at which the central bank (rbi) borrows money from commercial bank
5806,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, reverse repo rate is increased, it encourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank to earn higher return on idle cash"
5807,"it decreases the lending capability of commercial banks, which controls excess demand"
5808,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, reverse repo rate is decreased, it discourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank"
5809,"it increases the lending capability of commercial banks, which controls deficient demand"
5810,(iv) open market operations (omo) • it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
5811,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, central bank sells government securities and bonds to commercial bank"
5812,"with the sale of these securities, the power of commercial bank of giving loans decreases, which will control excess demand"
5813,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, central bank purchases government securities and bonds from commercial bank"
5814,"with the purchase of these securities, the power of commercial bank of giving loans increases, which will control deficient demand"
5815,"(v) varying reserve requirements • banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank, which is known as legal reserve ratio"
5816,one is the cash reserve ratio or crr and the other is the slr or statutory liquidity ratio
5817,"• cash reserve ratio: -> it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits, which it is required to keep with the central bank"
5818,commercial banks have to keep with the central bank a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash reserves as a matter of law
5819,"-> for example, if the minimum reserve ratio is 10% and total deposits of a certain bank is rs"
5820,"-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, cash reserve ratio (crr) is raised to 20 per cent, the bank will have to keep rs.20 crore with the central bank, which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy, which will control excess demand"
5821,"-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, cash reserve ratio (crr) falls to 5 per cent, the bank will have to keep rs"
5822,"5 crore with the central bank, which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increasing credit availability in the economy, which will control deficient demand"
5823,"(vi) the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) • it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves"
5824,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the central bank increases statutory liquidity ratio (slr), which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy"
5825,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, the central bank decreases statutory liquidity ratio (slr), which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increases credit availability in the economy"
5826,• it may consist of: -> excess reserves -> unencumbered (are not acting as security for loans from the central bank) government and other approved securities (securities whose repayment is guaranteed by the government); and -> current account balances with other banks
5827,(b) qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy: these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
5828,they are as under: (i) imposing margin requirement on secured loans • business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
5829,bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
5830,"• so, the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement"
5831,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, central bank raises marginal requirements"
5832,this discourages borrowing because it makes people gets less credit against their securities
5833,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, central bank decreases marginal requirements"
5834,this encourages borrowing because it makes people get more credit against their securities
5835,"(ii) moral suasion • moral suasion implies persuasion, request, informal suggestion, advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank"
5836,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, it appeals for credit contraction"
5837,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, it appeals for credit expansion"
5838,(iii) selective credit controls (sccs) • in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
5839,"• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the central bank introduces rationing of credit in order to prevent excessive flow of credit, particularly for speculative activities"
5840,"• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, the central bank withdraws rationing of credit and make efforts to encourage credit"
5841,"commercial bank: commercial bank is a financial institution which performs the functions of accepting deposits from the public and making loans and investments, with the motive of earning profit"
5842,legal reserve ratio: it is the minimum ratio of deposits legally required to be kept by the commercial banks with themselves (statutory liquidity ratio) and with the central bank (cash reserve ratio)
5843,"money multiplier or credit multiplier: when the primary cash deposit in the banking system leads to multiple expansion in the total deposits, it is known as money multiplier or credit multiplier"
5844,central bank: the central bank is the apex institution of a country’s monetary system
5845,the design and the control of the country’s monetary policy is its main responsibility
5846,quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy: these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of money/credit in the economy
5847,qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy: the instruments which are used to regulate the direction of credit is known as qualitative instruments
5848,bank rate: it is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral (security for purpose of loan)
5849,repo rate: it is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
5850,reverse repo rate: it is the rate at which the central bank (rbi) borrows money from commercial bank
5851,open market operation: it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
5852,"cash reserve ratio: it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits, which it is required to keep with the central bank"
5853,"statutory liquidity ratio: it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves"
5854,marginal requirement: business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
5855,bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
5856,"so, the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement"
5857,"moral suasion: it implies persuasion, request, informal suggestion, advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank"
5858,selective credit controls (sccs): in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
5859,(iii) government demand for goods and services its curve is upward sloping rises up to right
5860,"• in a modern economy, the government is an important buyer of goods and services"
5861,"it is income inelastic, i.e., it is not affected by change in income level"
5862,the volume of autonomous investment is the same at all levels of income
5863,"• the government demand may be on account of public needs for roads, schools, hospitals, power, irrigation etc, for the maintenance of law and order and for defence"
5864,(iv) demand for net export (x – m) • net export represents foreign demand for goods and services produced by an economy
5865,"• when exports exceed imports, net exports is positive and when imports exceed, net exports is negative"
5866,"• exports and imports of a country are influenced by a number of factors such as foreign trade policy, exchange- rate, prices and quality of goods etc"
5867,"however, for the sake of simplicity keynes included only two types of demand, -> consumption demand (c) -> investment demand (i) aggregate demand can be explained with the help of ad schedule and ad curve"
5868,aggregate supply: (a) the concept of aggregate supply (δs) is related with the total supply of goods and services by all the producers in an economy
5869,"four factor of production like land, labour, capital and enterprise are required for the production of goods and services"
5870,"producers pay rent to land, wages and salaries to labour, interest to capital and profits to the entrepreneur for their services in production"
5871,this payment is factor- cost from producer’s point of view and factor-income from factor-owner angle
5872,"(b) thus, aggregate supply is the total amount of money value of goods and services, (which is paid to the factor of production against their factor services) that all the producers are willing to supply in an economy"
5873,"in other words, it is the total cost of production of goods and services produced in a country or it is the value of net national product at factor cost (nnpfc)"
5874,"thus, the main components of aggregate supply are: (c) keynes assumed his economy to be a closed capitalist economy and whenever any economy is closed capitalist, then net factor income from abroad (nfia) is 0"
5875,"national income (nnpfc) = domestic income (ndpfc) + net factor income from abroad (nfia) national income (nnpfc) = domestic income (ndpfc) + 0 in short, aggregate supply = nnpfc = ndpfc = factor income = rent + interest + wages + profit (d) as we know income is either consumed or saved, hence for the sake of simplicity keynes has regarded only two main constituents of aggregate supply: consumption function(propensity to consume)and its types,saving function (propensity to save) and its types 1"
5876,consumption function expresses functional relationship between aggregate consumption and national income
5877,"c = f (y) where, c = consumption; f = function; y = disposable income consumption at a point of time can be measured with the equation: 2"
5878,"according to keynes, as income increases consumption expenditure also increases but increase in consumption is smaller than the increase in income"
5879,"according to keynes, propensity to consume of the people remains stable in the short period"
5880,break-even point refers to that point in the level of income at which consumption is just equal to income
5881,"in other words, whole of income is spent on consumption and there is no saving"
5882,"below this level of income, consumption is greater than income but above this level, income is greater than consumption"
5883,"in the given imaginary household schedule of consumption and saving, at annual income level of rs.60,000, consumption is rs.60,000 and in consequence there is no saving"
5884,"it is evident from the table and diagram that: (i) as the income increases, consumption also increases, but the increase in consumption remains less than the increase in income"
5885,(ii) income can be zero but consumption can never be zero in the economy
5886,thus break-even point indicates a point where consumption becomes equal to income or consumption curve cuts the income curve
5887,"there are two types of propensity to consume: (a) average propensity to consume (apc) (i) the ratio of aggregate consumption expenditure to aggregate income is known , as average propensity to consume"
5888,it indicates the percentage (or ratio) of income which is being spent on consumption
5889,it is worked out by dividing total consumption expenditure (c) by total income (y)
5890,"a consumption (c) (ii) it can be explained with the help of following schedule and diagram: (iii) important points for apc: • when apc is more than 1: when apc is more than 1, consumption is more than national income, i.e"
5891,"• apc = 1: when apc is equal to 1, consumption is equal to national income, which is known as to be break-even point"
5892,"• when apc is less than 1: when consumption is less than national income, i.e"
5893,(b) marginal propensity to consume (mpc): (i) the ratio of change in consumption (c) to change in income (y) is known as marginal propensity to consume
5894,it indicates the proportion of additional income that is being spent on consumption
5895,"• mpc falls with the successive increase in income: it happens because as an economy becomes richer, it has the tendency to consume smaller percentage of each increment to its income"
5896,(a) propensity to save (or saving function) shows the functional relationship between aggregate savings and income
5897,it is evident from the saving-function schedule and diagram that as income increases saving also increases
5898,"prior to break-even point saving is negative, at break-even point saving is zero and after the break-even point saving is positive"
5899,"(c) important points for saving function: (i) starting point of saving curve: • saving curve (ss) starts from point _c on the y-axis, indicating that there is negative saving (equal to amount of autonomous consumption) when national income is zero"
5900,note: the saving curve will have a negative intercept on y-axis of the same magnitude as the consumption curve has positive intercept on the y-axis
5901,"it happens because if consumption is positive at zero level of income, then there would be dis-savings of the same magnitude"
5902,saving curve crosses the x-axis at point r which is known as break-even point as at this point saving is zero (or consumption is equal to income)
5903,types of propensity to save (a) average propensity to save (aps): (i) the ratio of aggregate saving to aggregate income is known as average propensity to save (aps)
5904,"symbolically, (ii) important points for aps: • aps can never be 1 or more than one"
5905,as saving can never be equal to or more than national income
5906,"• aps can be 0: aps is 0 when income is equal to consumption i.e., saving = 0"
5907,at income levels which are lower than the break-even point aps can be negative as there will be dis-savings in the economy
5908,• aps rises with the increase in income because the proportion of income saved keeps on increasing
5909,(b) marginal propensity to save: (i) the ratio of change in saving (δs) to change in income (δy) is called mps
5910,it is proportion of income saved out of additional (incremental) income
5911,aggregate demand: it is aggregate expenditure on ex-ante (planned) consumption and ex-ante (planned)investment that all sectors of the economy are willing to incur at each income level
5912,induced investment: it refers to the investment which is made with the motive of earning profit
5913,"autonomous investment: it refers to the investment, which is made irrespective of level of income"
5914,"aggregate supply: aggregate supply is the total amount of money value of goods and services, (which is paid to the factor of production against their factor services) that all the producers are willing to supply in an economy"
5915,consumption function: consumption function(propensity to consume) expresses functional relationship between aggregate consumption and national income
5916,c = f (y) and c = c + b y 6
5917,"(c), which is needed for survival, i.e., consumption at zero level of national income"
5918,"keynes’ psychological law of consumption: according to keynes, as income increases consumption expenditure also increases but increase in consumption is smaller than the increase in income"
5919,break even point: break-even point refers to that point in the level of income at which consumption is just equal to income
5920,"in other words, whole of income is spent on consumption and there is no saving"
5921,average propensity to consume: the ratio of aggregate consumption expenditure to aggregate income is known as average propensity to consume
5922,marginal propensity to consume: the ratio of change in consumption (c) to change in income (y) is known as marginal propensity to consume
5923,it indicates the proportion of additional income that is being spent on consumption
5924,saving function: saving function (propensity to save) shows the functional relationship between aggregate savings and income
5925,s = f (y) and s = — c + (1 — b) y 12
5926,average propensity to save: the ratio of aggregate saving to aggregate income is known as average propensity to save (aps)
5927,marginal propensity to save: the ratio of change in saving (δs) to change in income (δy) is called mps
5928,it is proportion of income saved out of additional (incremental) income
5929,(a) price of the commodity: (i) positive relationship exists between price of the commodity and supply of that commodity
5930,"(ii) it means, with the rise in price of the commodity, the supply of that commodity also rises and vice-versa"
5931,"(b) price of the factors of production: (i) this also influences the supply since price of factors (rent, wages, interest, profit) constitutes the cost of production of a commodity"
5932,(ii) an increase in the price of a factor of production may lead to fall in production of a commodity shifting the supply curve to the left
5933,"(iii) as against it, a producer may supply more of a commodity at a given price if the prices of factors fall shifting the supply curve to the right"
5934,"(c) state of technology: (i) when there is technological progress in the firm, then cost of production will decrease, which leads to increase in the profit margin of the firm and thereby shifts the supply curve rightward"
5935,(ii) supply of those goods which are being produced with old and inferior technology causing increase in cost of production will decrease the total output and shift the supply curve to the left
5936,(d) unit tax: (t) a unit tax is a tax that the government imposes per unit sale of output
5937,"(ii) for example, suppose that the unit tax imposed by the government is"
5938,"then, if the firm produces and sells 20 units of the goods, the total tax that the firm must pay to the government is 20 * 3 = 60"
5939,"(iii) so, if the unit tax increases, the firm’s cost of production increases which will shift the supply curve leftward"
5940,"similarly, if the unit tax decreases, the firm’s cost of production decreases, which will shift the supply curve rightward"
5941,(e) price of other goods: (i) suppose a firm produces more than one product with its given resources
5942,(ii) an increase in the price of other goods induces the firm to produce more of other goods to earn more profit and less of goods whose prices remained unchanged
5943,"(f) objective of the firm: (i) sometimes a firm may be induced to increase supply of a commodity not because it is more profitable, but because its supply is a source of status and prestige in the market"
5944,"(ii) similarly, a firm may increase production just to achieve the goal of maximum sale or maximum employment"
5945,"factors affecting market supply: (a) price of the commodity (b) price of the factors of production (c) state of technology (d) unit tax (e) price of other goods (f) objective of the firm (g) number of firms in the market: (i) when the number of firms in the industry increases, market supply also increases due to large number of producers producing that commodity"
5946,"(ii) however, market supply will decrease, if some of the firms start leaving the industry due to losses"
5947,"(h) future expectation regarding price: (i) if sellers expect a rise in price in near future, current market supply will decrease in order to raise the supply in future at higher prices"
5948,"(ii) however, if the sellers fear that the prices will fall in the future, they will increase the present supply to avoid losses in future"
5949,"(i) means of transportation and communication: proper infrastructural development, like improvement in the means of transportation and communication, helps in maintaining adequate supply of the commodity"
5950,supply function shows the relationship between quantity supplied for a particular commodity and the factor influencing it
5951,individual supply function refers to the functional relationship between supply and factors affecting the supply of a commodity
5952,"it is expressed as, sx = f (px , p0 , pf, st , t, o) where, sx  = supply of the given commodity x"
5953,(a) market supply function refers to the functional relationship between market supply and factors affecting the market supply of a commodity
5954,"(b) as we know, market supply is affected by all the factors affecting the individual supply"
5955,"(c) in addition, it is also affected by some other factors like number of firms, future expectations regarding price and means of transportation and communication"
5956,"market supply function is expressed as, sx = f(px, p0, pf, st, t, o, n, f, m) where, sx = market supply of given commodity x"
5957,supply schedule is a table showing various quantities of a commodity offered for sale corresponding to different possible prices of that commodity
5958,supply schedule is of two types: (a) individual supply schedule (b) market supply schedule
5959,individual supply schedule refers to the supply schedule of an individual firm in the market
5960,"as seen in the schedule, quantity supplied of commodity x increases with the increase in price"
5961,the producer is willing to sell 50 units of x at a price of
5962,market supply schedule refers to supply schedule of all the firms in the market producing a particular commodity
5963,it is obtained by adding all the individual supplies at each and every level of price
5964,"where sm is the market supply and sa + sb+ … are the individual supply of supplier a, supplier b and so on"
5965,let us understand the derivation of market supply schedule with the help of table (assuming that there are only 2 producers a and b in the market)
5966,as seen in table market supply is obtained by adding the supplies of suppliers a and b at different prices
5967,"so, market supply schedule also shows the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied"
5968,"it shows direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, keeping other factor constant"
5969,supply curve is of two types: (a) individual supply curve (b) market supply curve 13
5970,(a) individual supply curve refers to a graphical representation of individual supply schedule
5971,"(b) with the help of information given in supply schedule (see table), the supply curve for an individual firm can be drawn as shown in figure: (c) in figure, quantity supplied is taken on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis"
5972,"at each possible price, there is a quantity, which the firm is willing to sell"
5973,(d) point ‘a’ shows that 50 units are supplied at the price of rs
5974,"(e) by joining all the points (a to e), we get a curve that slopes upward"
5975,the supply curve ss slopes upward due to positive relationship between price and quantity supplied
5976,(a) market supply curve refers to a graphical representation of market supply schedule
5977,(b) let us graphically convert the market supply schedule (table) into a market supply curve (see figure)
5978,"(c) as seen in the diagram, quantity supplied is shown on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis"
5979,market supply curve (sj) is obtained by horizontal summation of the individual supply curves
5980,10 per unit both the firms will supply a total number of 150 units
5981,(e) market supply curve is also positively sloped due to positive relationship between price and quantity supplied
5982,"it happens because with a rise in price, the proportionate rise in market supply is more than the proportionate rise in individual supplies"
5983,"(a) other things being constant (ceteris paribus), based on price of the commodity; then it is known as law of supply"
5984,"it means, quantity supplied of the commodity rises due to rise in price of the commodity and vice-versa"
5985,(b) ceteris paribus means: (i) price of other commodity remains constant
5986,(c) the law of supply makes a qualitative statement only and not quantitative
5987,it indicates the direction of change in the amount supplied and it does not indicate the magnitude of change
5988,it explains only the effect of change in price on the quantity supplied
5989,it states nothing about the effect of change in quantity supplied on the price of the commodity
5990,(e) the schedule and diagram are as follows: movement along the supply curve or change in quantity supplied 1
5991,it is based on law of supply which states that quantity supplied of the commodity changes due to the change in price of the commodity
5992,the change in quantity supply due to the change in the price of the commodity is known as movement along the supply curve
5993,"it may be of two types; namely, (a) expansion in supply (increase in quantity supplied) (b) contraction in supply (decrease in quantity supplied) 3"
5994,expansion in supply (increase in quantity supplied or upward movement along supply curve): (a) it is based on law of supply which states that quantity supplied of a commodity rises due to the rise in price of the commodity
5995,(b) the rise in quantity supplied due to the rise in price of the commodity is known as expansion in supply
5996,(c) in the given diagram price is measured on vertical axis whereas quantity supplied is measured on horizontal axis
5997,"but, due to the rise in price from op to op1, the quantity supplied increases from oq to oq1; which is known as expansion in supply"
5998,contraction in supply (decrease in quantity supplied or downward movement along supply curve): (a) it is based on law of supply which states that quantity supplied of a commodity falls to the fall in the price of the commodity
5999,(b) the fall in the quantity supplied due to the fall in price of the commodity is known as contraction in supply
6000,"(c) in the given diagram, quantity supplied is measured on horizontal axis and price is measured on vertical axis"
6001,"but, due to fall in price from op to op1, the quantity supply falls from oq to oq1, which is called contraction in supply"
6002,"if supply changes due to the change in the factors other than price, then it is known as shift in supply curve"
6003,it may be of two types: (a) increase in supply (b) decrease in supply (a) increase in supply: (i) an increase in supply means that producers now supply more at a given level of price of a commodity
6004,(ii) it’s conditions are: • fall in the prices of remuneration of factors of production
6005,"• change in objective of producer (inducing them to increase supply at the same price.) (iii) in the given diagram price is measured on vertical axis whereas, quantity supplied is measured on horizontal axis"
6006,"but, due to the changes in the factors other than price, the supply curve shifts rightward from ss to s1s1"
6007,"with the rightward shift in supply curve from ss to s1s1, the quantity supplied rises from oq to oq1; which is known as increase in supply"
6008,(b) decrease in supply: (i) a decrease in supply means that producers now supply less at a given level of price of a commodity
6009,(ii) it’s conditions are: • rise in the prices of remuneration of factors of production
6010,• change in objective of producer (inducing them to decrease supply at the same price)
6011,"(iii) in the given diagram, quantity supplied is measured on horizontal axis whereas price is measured on vertical axis"
6012,"but, due to changes in the factors other than price the supply curve shifts leftward from ss to s1s1 with the leftward shift in the supply curve from ss to s1s1 the quantity supplied falls from oq to oq1, which is known as decrease in supply"
6013,there is a positive relationship between price of the commodity and quantity supplied for that commodity which causes supply curve to slope upward from left to right
6014,it is because of the following reasons: (a) change in stock: (i) with the increase in the price of the commodity sellers are ready to sell more from their old stock of goods
6015,"(ii) on the other hand, when price of a commodity decreases, sellers would like to increase their stock to avoid losses"
6016,(b) profit and loss: with the rise in price producers generally increase their production in view of higher profit possibilities and vice-versa
6017,"(c) entry or exit of firms: (i) when the price of a commodity increases, new firms enter into the industry with the view to earn profits which in turn increases the supply"
6018,"(ii) on the other hand, when price starts falling, marginal firms (or inefficient firms) leave the market to avoid expected losses which thereby decreases the supply"
6019,exceptions to law of supply are: (a) future expectations: (i) the law will not apply if there are future expectations for further change in prices
6020,"(ii) for example, if sellers expect further fall in prices in future, they would be ready to sell more even at low prices"

6029,"(b) it is quantitative statement, i.e., it tells us the magnitude of the change in quantity supplied as a result of change in price"
6030,"percentage method/flux method for calculating price elasticity of supply: according to this method, elasticity is measured as the ratio of percentage change in the quantity supplied to percentage change in the price"
6031,"(i) for example, perishable goods have inelastic supply (because their supply cannot be increased or decreased) while the supply of durable goods is elastic"
6032,"(ii) likewise, the supply of agricultural goods is inelastic while it is elastic in case of industrial goods"
6033,"(b) cost of production (i) if cost of production rises rapidly with the increase in output, there is less incentive to raise the supply with the increase in price"
6034,"(ii) however, if cost of production increases slowly with the rise in output, supply will increase with the rise in prices"
6035,"(c) time period (i) in the market period, supply of a commodity is perfectly inelastic as supply cannot be changed immediately with the change in price"
6036,"(ii) in the short period, supply is relatively less elastic as firm can change the supply by changing the variable factors"
6037,"(iii) in the long period, supply is more elastic as all the factors can be changed and supply can be easily adjusted as per changes in price"
6038,"(d) technique of production (i) if simple techniques of production are employed in the production of a commodity, its supply will be elastic"
6039,"(ii) on the other hand, it becomes very difficult to change supply (in response to change in price) under complex techniques of production"
6040,"(e) availability of resources and facilities (i) the production of a commodity requires adequate resources and other facilities like irrigation, power, transportation, banking, etc"
6041,"(ii) on the other hand, if these resources and facilities are easily and adequately available, producers can easily respond to any change in price"
6042,time horizons and supply curve time period which is available to a firm to adjust its supply also plays an important role in the shapes of supply curves
6043,"(a) short period: (i) in the short period, supply is relatively less elastic as firm can change the supply by changing the variable factors only, as fixed factors cannot be change during short period"
6044,"the supply curve during short period is inelastic, i.e., percentage change in quantity supplied is less than percentage change in price as shown in the adjacent figure"
6045,"(b) long period: (i) in the long period, supply is more elastic as all the factors can be changed and supply can be easily adjusted as per changes in price"
6046,"(ii) the supply curve during long period is elastic, i.e., percentage change in quantity supplied is greater than percentage change in price as shown in the adjacent figure"
6047,"(c) very short period (market period): (i) in very short period (market period), it becomes very difficult for a firm to increase its production level even if price of its commodity has increased because factor inputs like new machinery, technical labour, etc"
6048,"(ii) under such a situation, individual and market supply curve will take the shape of vertical line parallel to y-axis as shown in the adjacent figure"
6049,stock: it refers to total quantity of a particular commodity that is available with the firm at a particular point of time
6050,"supply: it refers to the quantity of a commodity that a firm is willing and able to offer for sale, at each possible price during a given period of time"

6066,expansion in supply: the rise in quantity supplied due to the rise in price of the commodity is known as expansion in supply
6067,contraction in supply: the fall in the quantity supplied due to the fall in price of the commodity is known as contraction in supply
6068,"shift in supply curve: if supply changes due to the change in the factors other than price, then it is known as shift in supply curve"
6069,increase in supply: an increase in supply means that producers now supply more at a given level of price of a commodity
6070,decrease in supply: a decrease in supply means that producers now supply less at a given level of price of a commodity
6071,"elasticity of supply: the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied due to the changes in determinants of supply (price of other commodity, price of factors of production, technology, etc) is known as elasticity of supply"
6072,price elasticity of supply: the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied due to the changes in price of the commodity is known as price elasticity of supply
6073,(a) demand curve of foreign exchange slopes downwards due to inverse relationship between demand for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate
6074,"(b) in figure, demand for foreign exchange (us dollar) and rate of foreign exchange are shown on the horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively"
6075,"it means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increase (d) this is due to the fact that rise in the price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods, which make them more expensive"
6076,sources of supply of foreign exchange: the supply (inflow) of foreign exchange comes from the people who receive it due to the following reasons
6077,(a) exports of goods and services: supply of foreign exchange comes through exports of goods and services
6078,"(b) tourism: the amount, which foreigners spend in the home country, increases the supply of foreign exchange"
6079,(c) remittances (unilateral transfers) from abroad: supply of foreign exchange increases in the form of gifts and other remittances from abroad
6080,(d) loan from rest of the world: it refers to borrowing from abroad
6081,"(e) foreign investment: the amount, which foreigners invest in our home country, increases the supply of foreign exchange"
6082,(f) speculation: supply of foreign exchange comes from those who want to speculate on the value of foreign exchange
6083,"reasons of‘rise in supply’ of foreign currency: the supply of foreign currency rises in the following situations: (a) when price of a foreign currency rises, domestic goods become relatively cheaper"
6084,it induces the foreign country to increase their imports from the domestic country
6085,"for example, if price of 1 us dollar rises from rs"
6086,"65, then exports to usa will increase as indian goods will become relatively cheaper"
6087,"(b) when price of a foreign currency rises, foreign direct investment (fdi)"
6088,"from rest of the world increases, which will increase the supply for foreign exchange"
6089,"(c) when price of a foreign currency rises, supply of foreign currency also rises as people want to make gains from speculative activities"
6090,"supply curve of foreign exchange is upward sloping: (a) supply curve of foreign exchange slopes upwards due to positive relationship between supply for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate, which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases"
6091,(b) this makes home country’s goods become cheaper to foreigners since rupee is depreciating in value
6092,the demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases
6093,(c) the increased demand for our exports will translate into greater supply of foreign exchange
6094,"thus, the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases"
6095,"how foreign exchange is determine, disequilibrium conditions under exchange rate 1"
6096,"determination of foreign exchange rate: (a) exchange rate in a free exchange market is determined at a point, where demand for foreign exchange is equal to the supply of foreign exchange"
6097,"(b) let us assume that there are two countries – india and u.s.a – and the exchange rate of their currencies i.e., rupee and dollar is to be determined"
6098,"presently, there is floating or flexible exchange regime in both india and u.s.a"
6099,"therefore, the value of currency of each country in terms of the other currency depends upon the demand for and supply of their currencies"
6100,"(c) in the above diagram, the price on the vertical axis is stated in terms of domestic currency (that is, how many rupees for one us dollar)"
6101,"(d) in the above diagram, the demand curve [d$] is downward sloping"
6102,this means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increases
6103,"this is due to the fact that the rise in price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods, which make them more expensive"
6104,(e) the supply curve [s$] is upward sloping which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases
6105,this makes home country’s goods become cheaper to foreigners since rupee is depreciating in value
6106,the demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases
6107,the increased demand for our exports translates into greater supply of foreign exchange
6108,"thus, the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases"
6109,disequilibrium conditions under equilibriun exchange rate: (a)change in demand: (i) increase in demand for dollar: an increase in the demand for us dollar in india will cause the demand curve to shift to d1$ and the exchange rate rises to p1$
6110,note that increase in the exchange rate means that more rupees are required to buy one us dollar
6111,(b) change in supply (i) increase in supply for dollar: an increase in the supply of us dollar causes the supply curve to shift to s1$ and exchange rate falls to p1$
6112,"in this case, rupee cost of us dollar is decreasing and the indian rupee is said to be appreciating"
6113,(ii) decrease in demand for dollar: a decrease in the demand for us dollar in india will cause the demand curve to shift to d1$ and the exchange rate falls to p1$
6114,note that decrease in the exchange rate means that less rupees are required to buy one us dollar
6115,(ii) decrease in supply of dollar: a decrease in the supply of us dollar causes the supply curve to shift to s1$ and exchange rate rises to p1$
6116,"in this case, rupee cost of us dollar is increasing and the indian rupee is said to be depreciating"
6117,fixed exchange rate system (pegged exchange rate system): (a) meaning: (i) the system of exchange rate in which exchange rate is officially declared and fixed by the government is called fixed exchange rate system
6118,"(ii) when domestic currency is tied to the value of foreign currency, it is known as pegging"
6119,"(iii) to maintain stability in fixed exchange rate system, government buy foreign currency when exchange rate appreciates and sell foreign currency when exchange rate depreciate"
6120,"this process is called pegging operation, i.e., all efforts made by the central bank to keep the rate of exchange stable"
6121,note: (i) fixed exchange rate is not determined by the forces of demand and supply in the market
6122,such a rate of exchange has been associated with gold standard system during 1880-1914
6123,"(ii) according to this system, value of every currency is determined in terms of gold"
6124,"accordingly, ratio between gold value of the two countries was fixed as exchange rate between those currencies"
6125,"(iii) for example, value of one dollar = 100 gms of gold"
6126,"value of a rupee = 5 gms of gold then, 1 dollar = 100/5 = rs"
6127,"20 (b) merits of fixed exchange rate system: (i) stability: it ensures stability, in the international money market/exchange market"

6154,"(iii) effect of depreciation of domestic currency on exports: depreciation of domestic currency means a fall in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, $)"
6155,"it means, with the same amount of dollars, more goods can be purchased from india, i.e., exports to usa will increase as they will become relatively cheaper"
6156,(e) currency appreciation: (i) currency appreciation refers to increase in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency
6157,the domestic currency becomes more valuable and less of it is required to buy a-foreign currency

6159,"(iii) effect of appreciation of domestic currency on imports: appreciation of domestic currency means a rise in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, $)"
6160,"now, one rupee can be exchanged for more $, i.e., with the same amount of money, more goods can be purchased from the usa"
6161,it leads to increase in imports from the usa as american goods will become relatively cheaper
6162,managed floating rate system: (a) managed floating exchange rate is a mixture of a flexible exchange rate (the float part) and a fixed exchange rate (the managed part)
6163,"(b) in other words, it refers to a system in which foreign exchange is determined by free market forces (demand and supply forces), which can be influenced by the intervention of the central bank in foreign exchange market"
6164,"(c) under this system, also called dirty floating, central banks intervene to buy or sell foreign currencies in an attempt to stabilize exchange rate movements in case of extreme appreciation or depreciation"
6165,"spot market for foreign exchange: (a) if the operation is of daily nature, it is called spot market or current market"

6171,wider band system: (a) it is a system that allows wider adjustment in the fixed exchange rate system
6172,(b) it allows adjustment upto 10% around the “parity” between any two currencies in the internationahmoney market
6173,"(c) for example, if one us dollar is fixed as equal to fifty indian rupees, 10% revision (upward or downward) is to be allowed in this exchange rate of 1: 50"
6174,"exchange rate may be revised as, 1: 60 + 10% = 1: 66 or as 1: 60 – 10% = 1 : 54 2"
6175,crawling peg system: (a) it allows “small” but regular adjustments in the exchange rate for different currencies

6179,nominal effective exchange rate (neer): (a) the concept is useful for an aggregative analysis
6180,"a nation has to deal with a number of countries, and hence a number of currencies"
6181,"(b) for example, during a period indian rupee may be losing value against the american dollar, but it may be gaining value against euro"
6182,"(c) therefore, we would be interested in knowing what is happening in aggregate to our rupee i.e., is it gaining or losing"
6183,"(d) for this purpose, we prepare a basket of all the currencies which we are interested in, and find out the average of the changes in these currencies in a given period"
6184,"(e) so, finally neer is the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to other currencies without eliminating the effect of change in price"
6185,real exchange rate (rer): rer is the exchange rate which is calculated after eliminating the effects of price change

6216,(b) components of current account: the main components of current account are: (i) export and import of goods (merchandise transactions or visible trade): a major part of transactions in foreign trade is in the form of export and import of goods (visible items)
6217,payment for import of goods is written on the negative side (debit items) and receipt from exports is shown on the positive side (credit items)
6218,balance of these visible exports and imports is known as balance of trade (or trade balance)
6219,"(ii) export and import of services (invisible trade): it includes a large variety of non-factor services (known as invisible items) sold and purchased by the residents of a country, to and from the rest of the world"
6220,payments are either received or made to the other countries for use of these services
6221,"services are generally of three kinds: (a) shipping, (b) banking, and (c) insurance"
6222,payments for these services are recorded on the negative side and receipts on the positive side
6223,"(iii) unilateral or unrequisted transfers to and from abroad (one sided trans¬actions): unilateral transfers include gifts, donations, personal remittances and other ‘oneway’ transactions"
6224,"these refer to those receipts and payments, which take place without any service in return"

6234,"private and official transactions borrowing are of two components: (i) commercial borrowings, referring to borrowing by a country (including government and private sector) from international money market"
6235,"this involves market rate of interest without considerations of any concession, (ii) borrowings as external assistance, referring to borrowing by a country with considerations of assistance"

6263,"accommodating items (a) accommodating items refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions, i.e., such transactions are determined by net consequences of autonomous transactions"
6264,(h) these items are also known as ‘below the line items’
6265,"(c) for example, if there is a current account deficit in bop, then this deficit is settled by capital inflow from abroad"
6266,"the sources used to meet a deficit in bop, are: (i) foreign exchange reserves; (ii) borrowings from imf or foreign monetary authorities"
6267,deficit in bop (a) the balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of foreign countries during a given period of time
6268,(b) the transaction in the balance of payment account can be categorized as autonomous transactions and accommodating transactions
6269,(c) autonomous transactions are transactions done for some economic consideration such as profit
6270,"(d) when the total inflows on account of autonomous transactions are less than total outflows on account of such transactions, there is a deficit in the balance of payments account"
6271,"(e) suppose, the autonomous inflow of foreign exchange during the year is $500, while the total outflow is $600"
6272,disequilibrium in balance of payments: there are a number of factors that cause disequilibrium in the balance of payments showing either a surplus or deficit
6273,these causes are: (a) economic factors (i) large scale development expenditure that may cause large imports
6274,(ii) cyclical fluctuations in general business activity such as recession or depression
6275,(b) political factors: political factors instability may cause large capital outflows and hamper the inflows of foreign capital
6276,"(c) social factors: changes in tastes, preference and fashions of the people bring disequilibrium in bop by inflowing imports and exports"
6277,balance of payment: the balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions between its residents and residents of the foreign countries during a given period of time
6278,current account: it records imports and exports of goods and services and unilateral transfers
6279,capital account: capital account is that account which records all such transactions between residents of a country and rest of the world which cause a change in the asset or liability status of the residents of a country or its government
6280,"foreign direct investment: it refers to purchase of an asset in rest of the world, such that it gives direct control to the purchaser over the asset"
6281,portfolio investment: it refers to the purchase of financial asset by the foreigners that does not give the purchaser control over the asset
6282,balance: it means difference between the sum of credits and sum of debits
6283,balance of trade: the term “balance of trade” denotes the difference between the exports and imports of goods in a country
6284,balance on current account: it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on current account
6285,balance on current account = sum of credits on current account – sum of debits on current account 9
6286,balance on capital account: it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on capital account
6287,balance on capital account = sum of credits on capital account – sum of debits on capital account 10
6288,autonomous items: it refer to those international economic transactions in the current account and capital account which take place due to some economic motive such as profit maximisation
6289,"accommodating items: it refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions, i.e., such transactions are determined by net consequences of autonomous transactions"
6290,"(ii) to calculate total product, we have to use this farmula: total product=apl x units of variable factor 2.average product or average return to an input: it is per unit total product of variable factors"
6291,it is calculated by dividing the total product by the units of variable factor
6292,marginal product or marginal return to an input: it is an addition to the total product when an additional unit of a variable factor is employed
6293,it increases at an increasing rate (convex shape) from o to p and at a diminishing rate (concave shape) from p to a
6294,tp is maximum at a and remains so upto point b
6295,"mp curve initially rises, reaches its maximum and ultimately declines taking the shape of inverted u"
6296,"similarly, ap curve first rises, reaches its maximum and then declines taking the shape of an inverted u"
6297,"return to a variable factor states that change in the physical output of a good when only the quantity of one input is increased, while that of other input is kept constant"
6298,"the law of variable proportion states that as we increase the quantity of only one input, keeping other inputs fixed, the total product increases at an increasing rate (convex shape) in the beginning, then increases at diminishing rate (concave shape) and after a level of output ultimately falls"
6299,"assumptions of law of variable proportions (a) only one input is variable, the other is held constant or fixed"
6300,(b) it is possible to change the proportion in which the factor units are combined
6301,(b) the total product increases at an increasing rate (convex shape) up to point p
6302,the marginal physical product of labour (mp) is increasing and reaches its highest point pp vertically downwards to point p
6303,it stops increasing at an increasing rate and starts to increase at a diminishing rate
6304,"in the first stage, firm is moving towards achievement of ideal combination of factors in which tp is increasing at an increasing rate at every level of output"
6305,"so, instead of stopping its production, the firm will rather continue employing additional units of a variable factor"
6306,"phase ii: stage of diminishing returns or diminishing return to factor (a) the total product (tp) continues to increase, but at a diminishing rate (concave shape) and eventually becomes the highest"
6307,"(c) the stage comes to an end, when marginal product (mp) = 0 and total product (tp) is maximum and constant"
6308,the firm would like to operate in the second phase because tp is maximum and there is proper utilization of fixed factor
6309,phase iii: phase of negative returns or negative return to factor (a) in this stage the total product declines in absolute terms
6310,the firm cannot operate in the third stage where mp is negative and tp starts declining as we are moving beyond the optimum degree of specialisation
6311,"there are 3 important reasons or causes for the operation of increasing returns— (a) proper utilization of the fixed factor (i) in the initial stage of production the units of variable input i.e., labour) is so less that fixed inputs cannot be effectively utilized"
6312,"(ii) proper utilization of the fixed factor can be attained when more and more units of variable factor (labour units) are applied to the fixed factor (land), the fixed factor will be used intensively and output will increase rapidly"
6313,"(b) indivisibility of fixed factor (i) indivisibility of fixed factor means that due to technological requirements a minimum amount of fixed factor must be employed, whatever the level of output, i.e., fixed factor cannot be divided into smaller units"
6314,"(ii) thus, as more units of variable factors are employed with an indivisible fixed factor, output increases due to fuller and more effective utilization of the fixed factor"
6315,"(c) specialization and division of labour (i) initially there was only one labour working on all the 5 acres of land ploughing, watering, etc"
6316,"(ii) as the number of labour units increases, each worker specialized in a particular activity leads to specialization of the variable units and this resulted in increased output"
6317,"combination of variable factor with the fixed factor (i) when a given quantity of a fixed factor is combined with more and more units of variable factor, the additional units of variable factor will have smaller and smaller quantity of fixed factor to work with them"
6318,"(ii) as many workers share the same fixed factor, the share of each would obviously fall"
6319,"therefore, the cooperation of the fixed factor is not available to the same extent"
6320,"thus, an increase in the variable factor would add less and less to total output"
6321,(b) imperfect substitutes (i) diminishing return to factor occurs because variable factor and fixed factor are imperfect substitutes to each other
6322,"(ii) technically speaking, there is a limit to which variable factor can be applied to fixed factor and that limit depends upon the efficiency of fixed factor"
6323,"so, variable factor and fixed factor are imperfect substitutes to each other"
6324,"reasons for negative returns: (a) scarcity of fixed factor (i) during a short period, there is a limitation that we cannot change the fixed factor"
6325,"(ii) so, variable factor can be change upto a certain limit and that limit depends upon the efficiency of fixed factor"
6326,(b) efficiency of variable factor fall (i) in this stage the amount of variable factor becomes excessive relative to the fixed factor
6327,this happens when too many labour are engaged in cultivating on a given piece of land
6328,(ii) instead of helping each other in production they cause overcrowding and chaos and thus hamper each other’s work
6329,"in such a case, the contribution of additional labour to production is bound to be negative"
6330,"(iii) thus, the marginal returns become negative and the total returns start diminishing"
6331,(c) efficiency of fixed factor fall (i) too much of a variable factors may also lead to the inefficiency of the fixed factor as well
6332,"(ii) in case of machine, which is a fixed factor, too much of labour may cause lot of wear and tear of machinery, frequent breakdowns and excessive cost of maintenance"
6333,(iii) in such a situation it is advisable to reduce the units of the variable factor than to increase it with a view for getting maximum production
6334,"the law of diminishing marginal return states that when we applied more and more units of variable factor to a given quantity of fixed factor, total product increases at a diminishing rate and marginal product falls"
6335,law of diminishing marginal returns is a classical theory and classical economists treated it as a separate law
6336,"but according to modern economists, this law indicates just one aspect (aspect of diminishing returns) of law of variable proportion"
6337,in the above schedule and diagram when more units of variable factor are employed with a given quantity of fixed factor tp increases at a diminishing rate or mp goes on falling
6338,that is why shape of mp curve is a downward sloping
6339,production function: the relationship between physical input and physical output of a firm is generally referred to as production function
6340,"the general form of production function is, q = f ( x1 ,x2) where, q = output, x1 = 1 input like labour, x2 = another input like machinery 2"
6341,"variable factors: it refer to those factors, which can be changed in the short run"
6342,fixed factors: it refer to those factors which cannot be changed in the short run
6343,"short period: it refers to the period of time in which a firm cannot change some of its factors like plant, machinery, building, etc"
6344,"due to insufficiency of time but can change any variable factor like labour, raw material, etc"
6345,"long period: it refers to a time period during which a firm can change all its factors of production including machines, building, organization, etc"
6346,total product: it refers to total volume of goods and services produced by a firm with the given input during a specified period of time
6347,it is calculated by dividing the total product by the units of variable factor
6348,marginal product: it is an addition to the total product when an additional unit of a variable factor is employed
6349,"return to a factor: it states that change in the total output of a good when only the quantity of one input is increased, while that of other input is kept constant"
6350,"law of variable proportion: it states that as we increase the quantity of only one input, keeping other inputs fixed, the total product increases at an increasing rate in the beginning, then increases at diminishing rate and after a level of output ultimately falls"
6351,"law of diminishing marginal return: it states that when we applied more and more units of variable factor to a given quantity of fixed factor, total product increases at a diminishing rate and marginal product falls"
6352,"(b) price of related goods: it may be of two types: substitute goods complementary goods let us discuss it in detail, (i) substitute goods: substitute goods are those goods which can be used in place of another goods and give the same satisfaction to a consumer"
6353,there would always exist a direct relationship between the price of substitute goods and demand for given commodity
6354,"it means with an increase in price of substitute goods, the demand for given commodity also rises and vice-versa"
6355,(ii) complementary goods: complementary goods are those which are useless in the absence of another goods and which are demanded jointly
6356,there would always exist an inverse relationship between price of complementary goods and demand for given commodity
6357,"it means, with a rise in price of complementary goods, the demand for given commodity falls and vice-versa"
6358,"(c) income of a consumer: there are three types of goods: for normal commodity: for normal commodity, with a rise in income, the demand of the commodity also rises and vice-versa"
6359,"shortly, direct relationship exists between income of a consumer and demand of normal commodity"
6360,"for inferior goods: for inferior goods, with a rise in income, the demand of the commodity falls and vice-versa"
6361,"shortly, inverse relationship exists between income of a consumer and demand of inferior goods"
6362,"for necessity goods: for necessity goods, whether income increases or decreases, quantity demanded remains constant"
6363,"(d) taste and preferences of the consumer: tastes, preferences and habits of a consumer also influence its demand for a commodity"
6364,"for example, if black and white tv set goes out of fashion, its demand will fall"
6365,"similarly, a student may demand more of books and pens than utensils of his preferences and taste"
6366,"miscellaneous: some of the other factors affecting the demand of a consumer are: change in weather, change in number of family members, expected change in future price, etc"
6367,"market demand refers to the quantity of a commodity that all the consumers are willing and able to buy, at a particular price during a given period of time"
6368,factors affecting market demand: price of the commodity price of related commodity income of a consumer taste and preference of a consumer miscellaneous population size: demand increases with the increase in population and decreases with the decrease in population
6369,"this is because with the increase (or decrease) in population size, the number of buyers of the product tends to increase (or decrease)"
6370,"if composition of population changes, namely, female population increases, demand for goods meant for women will go up"
6371,distribution of income: market demand is also influenced by change in distribution of income in the society
6372,"if income is not equally distributed, there will be less demand"
6373,demand function shows the relationship between quantity demanded for a particular commodity and the factors that are influencing it
6374,individual demand function refers to the functional relationship between individual demand and the factors affecting the individual demand
6375,market demand function refers to the functional relationship between market demand and the factors affecting the market demand
6376,demand schedule is a table showing different quantities being demanded of a given commodity at various levels of price
6377,it shows the inverse relationship between price of the commodity and its quantity demanded
6378,it is of two types: individual demand schedule market demand schedule 10
6379,individual demand schedule refers to a table that shows various quantities of a commodity that a consumer is willing to purchase at different prices during a given period of time
6380,market demand schedule is a tabular statement showing various quantities of a commodity that all the consumers are willing to buy at various levels of price
6381,it is the sum of all individual demand schedules at each and every price
6382,"market demand schedule can be expressed as, movement along the demand curve or change in quantity demandend 1"
6383,it is based on law of demand which states that quantity demanded of the commodity changes due to the changes in price of the commodity
6384,the change in quantity demanded due to the change in price of the commodity is known as movement along the demand curve
6385,"it may be of two types; namely, (a) expansion in demand (increase in quantity demanded) (b) contraction in demand (decrease in quantity demanded) 3"
6386,expansion in demand (increase in quantity demanded or downward movement along the demand curve): (a) it is based on law of demand which states that quantity demanded of the commodity rises due to the fall in price of the commodity
6387,"(b) the rise in quantity demanded due to the fall in price of the commodity, is known as expansion in demand"
6388,(c) it is shown in the figure given below • in the given diagram price is measured on vertical axis whereas quantity demanded is measured on horizontal axis
6389,"• but, due to fall in price of the commodity from op to op1 the quantity demanded rises from oq to oq1 which is known as expansion in demand"
6390,(b) the fall in quantity demanded due to the rise in price of the commodity is known as contraction in demand
6391,"(c) this is shown in the figure given below: • in the given diagram, price is measured on vertical axis whereas quantity demanded is measured on horizontal axis"
6392,"• but, due to rise in price of the commodity from op to op1, the quantity demanded falls from oq to oq1 which is known as contraction in demand"
6393,"if demand changes due to the change in factors other than price, it is known as shift in demand curve"
6394,"it may be of two types, (a) increase in demand (b) decrease in demand (a) increase in demand: (j) an increase in demand means that consumers now demand more at a given price of a commodity"
6395,• income of a consumer rises in case of normal goods
6396,• income of a consumer falls in case of inferior goods
6397,"(iii) in the given diagram, price is measured on vertical axis whereas quantity demanded is measured on horizontal axis"
6398,"(iv) but, due to the change in factors other than price then demand curve shifts rightward from dd to d1d1"
6399,(v) with the rightward shift in demand curve from dd to d1d1 the quantity demanded rises from oq to oq1 which is known as increase in demand
6400,(b) decrease in demand: (i) a decrease in demand means that consumers now demand less at a given price of a commodity
6401,• income of a consumer falls in case of normal goods
6402,• income of a consumer rises in case of inferior goods
6403,(iii) in the given diagram price is measured on vertical axis whereas quantity demanded is measured on horizontal axis
6404,"(iv) but, due to the change in factor other than price, the demand curve shifts leftward to dd to d1d1 (v) with the leftward shift in demand curve from dd to d1d1, the quantity demanded falls from oq to oq1 which is known as decrease in demand"
6405,causes of law of demand and exceptions to law of demand 1
6406,there is a inverse relationship between price of the commodity and quantity demanded for that commodity which causes demand curve to slope downward from left to right
6407,"it is because of the following reasons: (a) income effect: (i) quantity demanded of a commodity changes due to change in purchasing power (real income), caused by change in price of a commodity is called income effect"
6408,(ii) any change in the price of a commodity affects the purchasing power or real income of a consumers although his money income remains the same
6409,(iii) when price of a commodity rises more has to be spent on purchase of the same quantity of that commodity
6410,"thus, rise in price of commodity leads to fall in real income, which will thereby reduce quantity demanded is known as income effect"
6411,it refers to substitution of one commodity in place of another commodity when it becomes relatively cheaper
6412,"(ii) a rise in price of the commodity let coke, also means that price of its substitute, let pepsi, has fallen in relation to that of coke, even though the price of pepsi remains unchanged"
6413,"so, people will buy more of pepsi and less of coke when price of coke rises"
6414,"(c) law of diminishing marginal utility: (i) this law states that when a consumer consumes more and more units of a commodity, every additional unit of a commodity gives lesser and lesser satisfaction and marginal utility decreases"
6415,"(ii the consumer consumes a commodity till marginal utility (benefit) he gets equals to the price (cost) they pay, i.e., where benefit = cost"
6416,"(iii) for example, a thirsty man gets the maximum satisfaction (utility) from the first glass of water"
6417,"lesser utility from the 2nd glass of water, still lesser from the 3rd glass of water and so on"
6418,"clearly, if a consumer wants to buy more units of the commodity, he would like to do so at a lower price"
6419,"(d) additional consumer: (i) when price of a commodity falls, two effects are quite possible: * new consumers, that is, consumers that were not able to afford a commodity previously, starts demanding it at a lower price"
6420,• old consumers of the commodity starts demanding more of the same commodity by spending the same amount of money
6421,(ii) as the result of old and new buyers push up the demand for a commodity when price falls
6422,exceptions to the law of demand are: (a) inferior good or giffen goods: (i) giffen goods are a special category of inferior goods in which demand for a commodity falls with a fall in its price
6423,"(ii) in case of certain inferior goods when their prices fall, their demand may not rise because extra purchasing power (caused by fall in prices) is diverted on purchase of superior goods"
6424,(b) goods expected to become scarce or costly in future: (i) these goods are purchased by the household in increased quantities even when their prices are rising upwards
6425,(ii) this is due to the fear of further rise in prices
6426,(c) goods of ostentation: (i) status symbol goods are purchased not because of their intrinsic value but because of status or prestige value
6427,"(ii) the same jewellery when sold at a lower price sells poorly but offered at two times the price, sells quite well"
6428,"necessities: (a) the law of demand is not seen operating in case of necessities of life such as food grain, salt, matchstick, milk for children, etc"
6429,(b) a minimum quantity of these goods has to be bought whether the prices are high or low
6430,"ignorance: being ignorant of prevailing prices, a consumer may buy more of a commodity when its price has gone up"
6431,"emergency: in times of emergency like flood, famine or war, the households do not behave in a normal way and consequently law of demand may not operate"
6432,demand: demand is a quantity of a commodity which a consumer wishes to purchase at a given level of price and during a specified period of time
6433,substitute goods: substitute goods are those goods which can be used in place of another goods and give the same satisfaction to a consumer
6434,complementary goods: complementary goods are those which are useless in the absence of other good and which are demanded jointly
6435,"normal goods: for normal commodity, with a rise in income, the demand of the commodity also rises and vice-versa"
6436,"inferior goods: for inferior goods, with a rise in income, the demand of the commodity falls and vice-versa"
6437,"market demand: market demand refers to the quantity of a commodity that all the consumers are willing and able to buy, at a particular price during a given period of time"
6438,demand function: it shows the relationship between quantity demanded for a particular commodity and the factors that are influencing it
6439,cross price effect: when demand for one commodity is affected by the change in the price of another commodity it is known as cross price effect
6440,law of demand: it states that price of the commodity and quantity demanded are inversely related to each other when other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus)
6441,movement along the demand curve: the change in quantity demanded due to the change in price of the commodity is known as movement along the demand curve
6442,"expansion in demand: the rise in quantity demanded due to the fall in price of the commodity, is known as expansion in demand"
6443,contraction in demand: the fall in quantity demanded due to the rise in price of the commodity is known as contraction in demand
6444,"shift in demand: if demand changes due to the change in factors other than price, it is known as shift in demand curve"
6445,increase in demand: an increase in demand means that consumers now demand more at a given price of a commodity
6446,decrease in demand: a decrease in demand means that consumers now demand less at a given price of a commodity
6447,"income effect: quantity demanded of a commodity changes due to change in purchasing power (real income), caused by change in price of a commodity is called income effect"
6448,substitution effect: it refers to substitution of one commodity in place of another commodity when it becomes relatively cheaper
6449,"law of diminishing marginal utility: this law states that when a consumer consumes more and more units of a commodity, every additional unit of a commodity gives lesser and lesser satisfaction and marginal utility decreases"
6450,giffen goods: giffen goods are a special category of inferior goods in which demand for a commodity falls with a fall in its price
6451,"in case of certain inferior goods when their prices fall, their demand may not rise because extra purchasing power (caused by fall in prices) is diverted on purchase of superior goods"
6452,the cost incurred on variable factors of production is known as tvc
6453,tvc is very much related with the production and fluctuates with the fluctuation in production
6454,"in case of zero level of production, tvc would also be zero"
6455,"for example, wages of casual labour, payment for raw material, etc"
6456,the shape of total variable cost is inverse s-shape because of law of variable proportion
6457,there are two phases on which shape of total variable cost depends
6458,"(a) in the first phase, tvc increase at a to lower cost of production"
6459,"this is because of proper utilization of fixed factor by employing more units of variable factor, specialization and division of labour"
6460,"diminishing rate, [concave shape] i.e., every additional unit of output produced leads (b) in the second phase, tvc increase at an increasing rate, [convex shape] i"
6461,"e., every additional unit of output produced leads to higher cost of production"
6462,this is because of non-optimal combination of variable factor with the fixed factor
6463,"during production, the expenditure incurred on various factors of production is known as total cost"
6464,"the thing, is has to remember, is that enterprise is one of the factors of production and the return of enterprise is normal profit"
6465,"in other words, it is a sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost"
6466,the shape of total cost is inverse s- shaped because of law of variable proportion
6467,(a) tc is divided into two parts tfc and tvc such that tc = tfc + tvc
6468,(b) tfc curve is a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis
6469,(c) tvc is inverse s-shaped starting from the origin due to law of variable proportion
6470,tc curve is inverse s-shaped starting from the level of fixed cost
6471,the reason behind it shape is the law of variable proportion
6472,the per unit cost incurred on fixed factors of production is known as average fixed cost
6473,afc falls as output increases because afc 3.the shape of afc curve is a rectangular hyperbola as area under afc curve (i.e
6474,the per unit cost incurred on variable factors of production is known as avc
6475,average variable cost is u-shaped because of law of variable proportion
6476,(a) as we know the shape of avc depends upon the shape of tvc
6477,"initially, tvc increases at diminishing rate (because total product increases at increasing rate), that makes the avc to fall"
6478,"(b) thereafter, tvc increases at increasing rate(because total product increases at diminishing rate), that makes the average variable cost to rise"
6479,"(c) so, from inverse s-shape, tvc curve, we derive the u shape avc curve"
6480,it can also be explained with the help of the following schedule and diagram
6481,the per unit cost incurred on various factors of production is known as average cost
6482,"in other words, it is the sum total of average variable cost and average fixed cost"
6483,average cost is u-shaped because of law of variable proportion: (a) the shape of average cost (ac) depends upon total cost (tc)
6484,"(b) initially, total cost (tc) increases at a diminishing rate (total product increases at increasing rate), which makes its average, i.e., average cost (ac) to fall, then reaches its minimum point"
6485,"(c) thereafter, total cost (tc) increases at increasing rate (total product increases at diminishing rate), which makes the average cost (ac) to rise"
6486,this type of production behaviour shows operation of law of variable proportion
6487,"average cost is also u-shaped because of average variable cost and average fixed cost: (a) in the beginning, we find that as output increases both avc and afc fall, therefore ac curve falls sharply"
6488,"(b) when avc has started rising and afc is falling, ac may continue to fall if the fall in afc is more than the rise in the avc curve"
6489,"(c) but with further increase in output, ac would start increasing because the rise in avc offsets the fall in afc"
6490,"(d) therefore, the shape of the ac curve would be u-shaped—first falling and then rising"
6491,the cost incurred on additional unit of output is known as marginal cost
6492,(a) as we know the shape of mc depends on the shape of tvc or tc
6493,"(b) initially, tvc increases at a diminishing rate (total product increases at increasing rate), which makes the gap of tvc, i.e"
6494,"(c) thereafter, tvc increases at an increasing rate (total product increases at diminishing rate) which makes the marginal cost to rise"
6495,"(d) so, from inverse s-shape tvc curve, we derive u shape mc curve"
6496,it can be explained with the-help of following schedule and diagram
6497,the relationship between marginal cost anci average cost can be shown with the help of schedule
6498,"the table given below shows the marginal costs, total costs and average costs at different levels of output"
6499,"(a) when mc is less than ac, ac falls (because mc pulls ac down)"
6500,it can be seen from the first three units of the table
6501,"(b) when mc = ac, ac is constant and at its minimum"
6502,it can be seen from the fourth unit of the table
6503,"(c) when mc is more than ac, ac rises (because mc pulls up ac)"
6504,it can be seen from the fifth unit of the table
6505,"the relationship between marginal cost and ave]rage cost with the help of diagram: (a) as long as mc is below ac, ac curve falls till intersection at point e"
6506,"(b) when mc curve comes to fall, it falls more rapidly than ac curve and reaches its minimum point b earlier than the ac curve reaches its minimum point e"
6507,"therefore, mc curve is rising from b to e whereas ac curve is still falling from a to e"
6508,"(c) when mc curve is rising, it cuts the ac curve at its minimum point e and after that point mc is above than ac"
6509,"when marginal cost falls, total cost increases at a diminishing rate"
6510,"when marginal cost is minimum (at point p), total cost is at its inflexion point (at point p1)"
6511,"3.when marginal cost rises, total cost increases at an increasing rate"
6512,"as long as mc curve is below than avc and ac curve, avc and ac curve fall till their intersection at a point e and e1 2"
6513,"when mc curve comes to fall, it falls much rapidly than avc and ac curves and reaches its minimum point a earlier than avc and ac curve reaches their minimum point e and e1 therefore, mc curve is rising from a to e whereas avc is still falling from b to e and similarly, mc is rising a to e1 and ac still falls from c to e1 3"
6514,"when mc curve is rising it cuts the avc and ac curves at their minimum point e and e1 thereafter, avc and ac curve rise because mc is above than avc and ac curves"
6515,the minimum point of avc curve (point b) will always occur to the right of the minimum point of mc curve (point a)
6516,"when avc is neither falling nor rising, mc = avc (point b)"
6517,there is a range over which avc is falling and mc is rising
6518,"cost in economics: it is the sum total of explicit cost, implicit cost and certain minimum profit (normal profit)"
6519,"explicit cost: it refers to the actual money expenditure of a firm on purchasing goods or hiring factor services and non-factor inputs (like raw material, electricity, fuel, etc.) 3"
6520,implicit cost: implicit cost is the imputed or estimated value of inputs supplied by the owner of the firm himself
6521,cost function: it shows functional relationship between output and cost of production
6522,it gives the least cost combination of inputs corresponding to different levels of output
6523,short run cost: short run cost are those in which some factors of production are fixed and others are variable
6524,total fixed costs: total fixed costs are those costs of production which do not change with a change in output
6525,total variable cost: the cost incurred on variable factors of production is known as tvc
6526,"total cost: during production, the expenditure incurred on various factors of production is known as total cost"
6527,average fixed cost: the per unit cost incurred on fixed factors of production is known as average fixed cost
6528,average variable cost: the per unit cost incurred on variable factors of production is known as avc
6529,average total cost/average cost (atc): the per unit cost incurred on various factors of production is known as average cost
6530,"in other words, it is the sum total of average variable cost and average fixed cost"
6531,marginal cost: the cost incurred on additional unit of output is known as marginal cost
6532,(a) the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price of commodity is known as price elasticity of demand
6533,"(b) it is quantitative statement, i.e., it tells us the magnitude of the change in quantity demanded as a result of change in price"
6534,the degree of responsiveness of demand to change in income of consumer is known as income elasticity of demand
6535,"the degree of responsiveness of demand to change in the price of related goods (substitute goods, complementary goods) is known as cross elasticity of demand"
6536,note: income and cross elasticity of demand is outside the scope of 12 class syllabus
6537,"percentage method/flux method for calculating price elasticity of demand: according to this method, price elasticity of demand is measured by dividing the percentage change in quantity demand by the percentage change in price"
6538,"note: mathematically speaking, price elasticity of demand (ep) is negative, since the change in quantity demanded is in opposite direction to the change in price"
6539,"but for the sake of convenience in understanding the magnitude of response of quantity demanded to the change in price, we ignore the negative sign and take into account only the numerical value of the elasticity"
6540,"thus, if 5% change in price leads to 15% change in quantity demanded of good x and 30% change in that of y, the above formula of elasticity will give the value of price elasticity of good x equal to 3 and of good y equal to 6"
6541,it indicates that the quantity demanded of good y changes much more than that of good x in response to a given change in price
6542,"but if we write minus signs before the numerical values of elasticities of two goods, that is, if we write the elasticities as – 3 and – 6 respectively as strict mathematics would require us to do, then since – 6 is smaller than – 3, we would be misled in concluding that price elasticity of demand of y is less than that of x"
6543,"but as we have noted above, response of demand for y to the change in price is greater than that of x, it is better to ignore minus signs and draw conclusions from the numerical values of elasticities"
6544,hence by convention minus sign before the value of price elasticity of demand is generally ignored in economics
6545,"(a) unitary elastic demand: if percentage change in the quantity demanded is equal to percentage change in price of the commodity, then ed = 1 and the result is known as unitary elastic demand"
6546,negative sign indicates the inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded
6547,"ped = 1 [unitary elastic demand] (b) more than unitary elastic demand or elastic demand: if percentage change in quantity demanded is more than the percentage change in price of the commodity then, ed > 1 and result is known as more than unit elastic demand"
6548,"(c) less than unitary elastic demand or inelastic demand: if percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price of the commodity, then ed < 1 and the result is known as less than unit elastic demand"
6549,"(d) perfectly elastic demand: if quantity demand changes and price remains constant, then ed = α and the result is known as perfectly elastic demand"
6550,"(e) perfectly inelastic demand: if price is changed ,and quantity demanded constant,then ed=0 and the result is known as perfectly inelastic demand"
6551,total outlay method or total revenue method or expenditure method for calculating price elasticity of demand (a) total expenditure method indicates the direction in which total expenditure on a product changes as a result of change in price of the commodity
6552,"(b) according to this method, there are three broad possibilities as shown below: case i: inelastic demand: (i) when the total expenditure (total revenue) varies directly with price, price elasticity of demand is less than one (i.e., demand is inelastic)"
6553,"(ii) in other words, with the fall in price, total expenditure (total revenue) decreases or with a rise in price, total expenditure (total revenue) increases"
6554,"case ii: elastic demand: (i) when the total expenditure (total revenue) varies inversely with price, price elasticity of demand is greater than one, (i.e"
6555,"(ii) in other words, with the fall in price, total expenditure (total revenue) increases, or with a rise in price, total expenditure (total revenue) decreases"
6556,"case iii: unitary price elasticity: (i) when the total expenditure (total revenue) remains the same, whatever may be the change in the price level, price elasticity of demand is said to be unity"
6557,"geometrical method or point method for calculating price elasticity of demand: (a) according to point method, elasticity of demand at any point is measured by dividing the lower segment of demand curve with the upper segment of the demand curve at that point"
6558,it can be calculated by dividing the lower segment by upper segment
6559,factors determining price elasticity of demand for a good they are as follows: 1
6560,nature of commodity: elasticity of demand of a commodity is influenced by its nature
6561,(a) the demand for necessities of life (commodities satisfying minimum basic needs) is less elastic
6562,they are required for human survival and they have to be purchased whatever may be the price
6563,"therefore, demand for necessities of life does not fluctuate much with price changes"
6564,"(b) whereas, demand for luxury goods is more elastic than the demand for necessities"
6565,"when the price of luxuries falls, consumers buy more of them and when the prices rises, demand contracts substantially"
6566,"please remember the term “luxury” is a relative term, as a luxury for a low-income earning worker may be a necessity for rich employer"
6567,"availability of substitutes/substitute goods: (a) if close substitutes for the commodity are available, the demand for the commodity will be elastic"
6568,the reason is that even a small rise in its prices will induce the buyers to go for its substitutes
6569,consumer will buy more of pepsi and less of relatively expensive coke
6570,"(b) however, the demand for a commodity (such as salt) having no close substitutes is inelastic"
6571,income level: (a) higher income level groups have less elasticity of demand for any commodity as compared to the people with low incomes
6572,it happens because rich people are not influenced much by changes in the price of goods
6573,"(b) but, poor people are highly affected by increase or decrease in the price of goods"
6574,"as the result of, demand for lower income group is highly elastic"
6575,"level of price/own price of a good: (a) higher own price of a good or costly goods like car, gold etc"
6576,have highly elastic demand as their demand is very sensitive to changes in their prices
6577,is inelastic as change in prices of such goods do not change their demand by a considerable amount
6578,"postponement of consumption: (a) commodities like ice cream, soft drinks, etc"
6579,"whose demand is not urgent, have highly elastic demand as their consumption can be postponed in case of an increase in their prices"
6580,"(b) however, commodities with urgent demand like life saving drugs, have inelastic demand because of their immediate requirement"
6581,"number of uses: (a) if the commodity under consideration has many alternative uses, its demand will be highly elastic"
6582,"(b) as against it, if commodity under consideration has only limited uses, its demand will be highly inelastic"
6583,"share in total expenditure: (a) if a smaller proportion of consumer’s income is spent on a particular commodity, its elasticity is highly inelastic because lesser proportion of consumer income is spent on consumption of these commodities"
6584,tends to be inelastic as consum ers spend a small proportion of their income on such goods
6585,"when prices of such goods change, consumers continue to purchase almost the same quantity of these goods"
6586,"(b) as against it, if a larger proportion of consumer income is spent on the commodity, elasticity of demand is highly elastic"
6587,time period: price elasticity of demand for a commodity also affected by time period
6588,(a) demand is inelastic in the short period as consumers find it difficult to change their habits during short period
6589,"(b) as against it, demand is highly elastic during long period as their is availability of close substitutes in long period"
6590,habits (a) the demand for those goods that are habitually consumed is inelastic
6591,"the reason is that such commodities become a necessity for the consumer, and even if prices change, consumers continue to purchase and consume the commodity"
6592,"examples of habit-forming commodities include alcoholic beverages, tobacco (in its various forms) consumption and even tea and coffee"
6593,"(b) as against it, if a person is not habitual, demand is elastic"
6594,"elasticity of demand: the degree of responsiveness of demand to the changes in determinants of demand (price of the commodity, income of a consumer, price of related commodity) is known as elasticity of demand"
6595,price elasticity of demand: the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price of commodity is known as price elasticity of demand
6596,"percentage method/flux method: according to this method, price elasticity of demand is measured by dividing the percentage change in quantity demand by the percentage change in price"
6597,"unitary elastic demand: if percentage change in the quantity demanded is equal to percentage change in price of the commodity, then ed = 1 and the result is known as unitary elastic demand"
6598,"more than unitary elastic demand or elastic demand: if percentage change in quantity demanded is more than the percentage change in price of the commodity then, ed > 1 and result is known as more than unit elastic demand"
6599,"less than unitary elastic demand or inelastic demand: if percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price of the commodity, then ed < 1 and the result is known as less than unit elastic demand"
6600,"perfectly elastic demand: if quantity demand changes and price remains constant, then ed = α and the result is known as perfectly elastic demand"
6601,"perfectly inelastic demand: if price changes, and quantity demand remains constant, then ed = 0 and the result is known as perfectly inelastic demand"
6602,total expenditure method: it indicates the direction in which total expenditure on a product changes as a result of change in price of the commodity
6603,"geometric method or point method: according to point method, elasticity of demand at any point is measured by dividing the lower segment of demand curve with the upper segment of the demand curve at that point"
6604,it can be calculated by dividing the lower segment by upper segment
6605,economic problem is a problem of choice involving satisfaction of unlimited wants out of limited resources having alternative uses
6606,"it can be used for constructing a house, a factory, a school, a park etc"
6607,"it can also be used for growing wheat, rice, vegetables etc"
6608,the economic problem here is that for which purpose this piece of land should be used
6609,"similar problems may arise in making a choice in the use of other resources like labour, capital and enterprise"
6610,economic problem arises because of scarcity of resources in relation to demand for them
6611,wants are unlimited: this is a basic fact of human life
6612,they are not only unlimited but also grow and multiply veiy fast
6613,resources are limited: the resources to produce goods and services to satisfy human wants are available in limited quantities
6614,"these resources are available in limited quantities in every economy, big or small, developed or underdeveloped, rich or poor"
6615,some economies may have more of one or two resources but not all the resources
6616,"for example, indian economy has relatively more labour but less capital and land"
6617,no economy in the world is rich in all the resources
6618,resources have alternative uses: generally a resource has many alternative uses
6619,"a worker can be employed in a factory, in a school, in a government office, self employed and so on"
6620,but the problem is that which resource should be put to which use
6621,“scarcity” in economics is the short supply of resources in relation to the demand
6622,resources of the economy are scarce with the result that the economy can’t produce all that the society needs
6623,"greater scarcity higher prices examples: petrol, diamonds lesser scarcity  lesser prices example: water no scarcity no price example: air we breathe 9"
6624,economising of resources means that resources are to be used in such a manner that the maximum output is realised per unit of input
6625,the problem of making a choice among alternative uses of resources is known as basic or central problem of an economy
6626,"there are many central problems of an economy, but according to syllabus we have to do one, that is; problem of allocation of resources: every economy has limited resources which can alternatively be used to produce different goods and services"
6627,"hence, it has to allocate its available resources in the production of different goods and services in such a manner that it ideally meets the needs of the society"
6628,"while allocating resources optimally, the decisions the following three central problems of an economy are required to be taken: what to produce"
6629,what to produce refers to a problem in which decision regarding which goods and services should be produced is to be taken
6630,"since its resources are limited, every economy has to decide what commodities are to be produced and in what quantities"
6631,"in view of limited resources when we produce more of a commodity, it means we will be able to produce less of another"
6632,because more production of one commodity would force us to withdraw resources from the production of the other commodity
6633,"so, the economy has to choose between capital goods (like machines, tools, etc.), civil goods (like cloth, watch, radio etc.), consumer goods (like wheat, cloth, shoes, sugar, etc.), military goods (like guns, bombs, tanks, etc.) necessities of life (such as food, clothing, housing, etc.) and luxury goods (such as car, colour tv, etc)"
6634,the guiding principle for an economy here is to allocate resources in such a way that gives maximum aggregate utility to the society
6635,how to produce refers to a problem in which decision regarding which technique of production should be used is taken
6636,"goods and services can be produced in two ways: by using labour intensive techniques, and by using capital-intensive techniques"
6637,"under labour intensive techniques, more of labour and less of capital per unit of output is used in producing goods and services, while in capital-intensive techniques more of capital and less of labour per unit of output is used"
6638,"thus, the economy has to decide whether the chosen goods and services should be produced with the help of automatic machines or handicrafts"
6639,"for example, on one side use of more capital; i.e., automatic machines, increases the quantity and improves the quality of production but it results in unemployment as it requires lesser number of labourers"
6640,"on the other side, handicrafts generate more employment but produce smaller amount of production"
6641,the guiding principle for an economy in such a case is to decide about the techniques of production on the basis of cost of production
6642,those techniques of production should be used which lead to the least possible cost per unit of commodity or service
6643,"for whom to produce refers to a problem in which decision regarding which category of people are going to consume a good, i.e., economically poor or rich"
6644,"as we know, goods and services are produced for those who can purchase them or have the capacity to buy them"
6645,capacity to buy depends upon how income is distributed among the factors of production
6646,"the higher the income, the higher will be the capacity to buy and vice versa"
6647,we know that the whole output is distributed among factors of production which have contributed to it
6648,"since production is the combined efforts of all the four factors of production, viz, land, labour, capital and enterprise, it is distributed among them in the form of money income (i.e"
6649,the guiding principle is that the economy must see here that important and urgent wants of its citizens are being satisfied to the maximum possible extent or not
6650,production possibility frontier is a curve which depicts all possible combinations of two goods which can be produced with given resources and technology in an economy
6651,production possibility frontier is also known as production possibility curve or transformation curve
6652,"the concept of pp curve is based on the following assumptions: first, the amount of resources in the economy is fixed"
6653,"fourth, all the resources are not equally efficient in production of all goods"
6654,production possibility frontier schedule and curve (a) it helps us to understand and solve the problem of what to produce and in what quantity
6655,"let us for the sake of simplicity assume that with given resources and technology, an economy can produce only two goods, namely rice and tanks as shown in the production possibility schedule"
6656,"(b) by plotting the data, we get the following pp curve: in the given diagram, tank is measured on vertical axis whereas rice is measured on horizontal axis"
6657,"if the economy decides to use all its resources in the production of tanks, oa quantity of tanks will be produced but rice cannot be produced"
6658,"on the other hand, if resources are devoted exclusively to the production of rice, of amount of rice will be produced but no tanks can be manufactured"
6659,another alternative is that the economy devotes a part of its resources to the production of tanks and a part to the production of rice
6660,"in that case there can be different possibilities of production as is indicated by the points b, c, d and e"
6661,"by joining points a, b, c, d, e and f of a curve, we get production possibility curve"
6662,(c) full employment and underemployment under pp curve (i) full employment of resources: it is represented along the pp-curve
6663,the economy has to decide that which combination of good x and good y should be produced
6664,it means that the economy has to decide that how should resources be allocated in the production of good x and good y
6665,the desired allocation of the two goods must lie somewhere on the pp curve
6666,"for example, point a on the pp represents one such allocation"
6667,"(ii) under utilization of resources: if resources are not fully and efficiently employed, may there be a problem of under utilization of resources"
6668,"the problem of unemployment: if the actual combination of two produced goods lies below the pp curve, it means that the resources are not fully employed"
6669,"if the resources are fully employed, the combination must lie somewhere on the pp curve"
6670,"for example, the combination ‘u’ below the pp curve represents unemployment, i.e., the resources are not fully utilized"
6671,"the problem of inefficiency: assuming that the resources are fully efficient, and if the actual combinations, say i, produced still lies below the pp curve, it means that resources are inefficiently employed"
6672,"so, any combination that lies below the pp curve also indicates the problem of inefficient utilization of resources"
6673,(d) rightward and leftward shift of pp curve (i) rightward shift (when both intercept changes) when resources increase: production possibility curve shows the combination of two pieces of goods which can be produced-by utilizing the resources efficiently
6674,"but, every economy tries to increase its resources so that more and more goods can be produced"
6675,pp curve is based on the assumption that the amount of resources in the economy is fixed
6676,"when resources are fixed, one or more goods can be produced only by sacrificing some quantity of the other good"
6677,"however, when resources increase, we can produce more pieces of both the goods"
6678,"for example, discovery of oil reserves in the gulf countries has caused a substantial shift to rightward in the ppc of these countries"
6679,"when technology changes: generally, the change in technology is for the better"
6680,better technology means that more quantities of both goods can be produced
6681,"(ii) rightward shift (when one intercept changes): in the given figure the improvement in technology, takes place only in one good, good x"
6682,there is no improvement in the technology’ of producing the good y
6683,"in such situations the production capacity of the country decreases, and the pp frontier shifts downwards"
6684,(e) the concept of opportunity cost has occupied a very important place in economics
6685,modern economists have used the concept of opportunity cost in allocation of resources besides other fields
6686,what is given up for getting something is called the opportunity cost of that thing
6687,"for instance, theoretically if a consumer has to forego 2 cups of tea for getting one glass of orange juice, opportunity cost of one glass of orange juice will be 2 cups of tea"
6688,thus opportunity cost of any commodity is the amount of other goods which has been given up in order to produce that commodity
6689,alternatively opportunity cost of a given activity is the value of the next best activity
6690,(f) marginal opportunity cost is an addition to a cost in terms of a number of units of a commodity sacrificed to produce one additional unit of another commodity
6691,(g) marginal rate of transformation is the ratio of number of units of a good sacrificed to produce one additional unit of another commodity
6692,(h) ppc is concave to the point of origin because of increasing marginal opportunity cost (moc)
6693,this behavior of the moc is based on the assumption that all resources are not equally efficient in production of all goods
6694,"rise in opportunity cost occurs when factors (resources) which are specialized or more adopted for production of a particular good (say, guns), is transferred to the production of another good (say, rice) for which they are less productive or less specialized"
6695,"thus, transfer of resources from more productive to less productive uses indirectly means fall in their productivity, with the result more of such resources are needed to produce an additional unit of the other commodity"
6696,thus marginal opportunity cost goes on increasing making the pp curve concave in shape
6697,"properties or characteristics of production possibilty curve ppc is downward sloping: the downward slope of ppc means that if the country wants to produce more of one good, it has to produce less quantity of the other goods"
6698,ppc is concave to the point of origin: concave shape of ppc implies that slope of ppc increases
6699,slope of ppc is defined as the quantity of good y given up in exchange for additional unit of good x
6700,"other shapes of ppc (a) moc decreasing: ppc would be convex to the point of origin, as shown below"
6701,"microeconomics and macroeconomics microeconomics microeconomics studies the behaviour of individual economic units of an economy, like households, firms, individual consumers and producers etc"
6702,"macroeconomics macroeconomics is that part of economic theory which studies the economy as a whole, such as national income, aggregate employment, general price level, aggregate consumption, aggregate investment, etc"
6703,economy: economy is a system which provides people with the means to work and earn a living
6704,economics: economics is about studying economic problems arising due to limited means (having alternative uses) in relation to unlimited wants
6705,economic problem: economic problem is a problem of choice involving satisfaction of unlimited wants out of limited resources having alternative uses
6706,scarcity: scarcity in economics is short supply in relation to the demand
6707,resources of the economy are scarce with the result that the economy can’t produce all that the society needs
6708,economising of resources: it means that resources are to be used in such a manner that the maximum output is realised per unit of input
6709,central problem of an economy: the problem of making a choice among alternative uses of resources is known as basic or central problem of an economy
6710,what to produce: what to produce refers to a problem in which decision regarding which goods and services should be produced is to be taken
6711,how to produce: how to produce refers to a problem in which decision regarding which technique of production should be used
6712,"for whom to produce: it refers to a problem in which decision regarding which category of people are going to consume a good, i.e., economically poor or rich"
6713,production: it is the process of transforming inputs (raw material) into output (finished goods)
6714,consumption: it is a process of using up of goods and services to satisfy human wants
6715,production possibility curve: it is a curve which depicts all possible combinations of two goods which can be produced with given resources and technology in an economy
6716,production possibilities: it refer to different combinations of goods and services which an economy can produce from a given amount of resources and a given stock of technology
6717,opportunity cost: opportunity cost of any commodity is the amount of other good which has been given up in order to produce that commodity
6718,alternatively opportunity cost of a given activity is the value of the next best activity
6719,marginal opportunity: it is an addition to a cost in terms of a number of units of a commodity sacrificed to produce one additional unit of another commodity
6720,marginal rate of transformation: it is the ratio of number of units of a good sacrificed to produce one additional unit of another commodity
6721,microeconomics: the term ‘micro’has been derived from greek word ‘mikros’means ‘small’
6722,"microeconomics, therefore, studies the behaviour of individual economic units of an economy, like households, firms, individual consumers and producers etc"
6723,"macroeconomics: it is that part of economic theory which studies the economy as a whole, such as national income, aggregate employment, general price level, aggregate consumption, aggregate investment, etc"
6724,cardinal utility approach (marginal utility analysis or marshall utility analysis): it states that the satisfaction the consumer derives by consuming goods and services can be measured with a number
6725,cardinal utility is measured in terms of utils (the units on a scale of utility or satisfaction)
6726,according to cardinal utility the goods and services that are able to derive a higher level of satisfaction to a consumer will be assigned higher utils and goods that result in a lower level of satisfaction will be assigned lower utils
6727,cardinal utility is a quantitative method that is used to measure consumption satisfaction
6728,hicks analysis):  it states that the satisfaction the consumer derives from the consumption of goods and services cannot be measured in numbers
6729,"rather, ordinal utility uses a ranking system in which a rank is provided to the satisfaction that is derived from consumption"
6730,"according to ordinal utility, the goods and services that offer a customer a higher level of satisfaction will be assigned higher ranks and the goods and services that offer a lower level of satisfaction will be assigned lower ranks"
6731,ordinal utility is a qualitative method that is used to measure consumption satisfaction
6732,total utility is the total psychological satisfaction a consumer obtains from consuming a given amount of a particular good
6733,"alternatively, total utility is the sum of marginal utilities obtained from consumption of successive units of a commodity"
6734,"tu = muj + mu2 + mu3 + mun = imu  for example, 4"
6735,marginal utility is the additional utility derived from consumption of an additional unit of a commodity
6736,law of diminishing marginal utility states that marginal utility derived from the consumption of a commodity declines as more units of that commodity are consumed
6737,"it’s can be seen from the above schedule that total utility increases at a diminishing rate, when marginal utility falls"
6738,law of diminishing marginal utility will operate only when consumption is a continuous process
6739,"for example, if one sandwich is consumed in the morning and another in the afternoon, the second sandwich may provide equal or higher satisfaction as compared to the first one"
6740,law of diminishing marginal utility will not be applied with regard to education/ knowledge because every effort to get education/ knowledge increases the utility
6741,"when mu is zero, tu is constant and maximum at p"
6742,consumer’s equilibrium refers to a situation where a consumer gets maximum satisfaction out of his given money income and given market price
6743,"consumer’s equilibrium through utility analysis can be ascertained with reference to: a single commodity two or several commodities (a) single commodity consumer equilibrium: (i) when purchasing a unit of a commodity, a consumer compares its price with the expected utility from it"
6744,"utility obtained is the benefit, and the price payable is the cost"
6745,he will buy the unit of a commodity only if the benefit is greater than or at least equal to the cost
6746,"(ii) equilibrium conditions for single commodity consumer equilibrium • necessary condition where, mu of one rupee refers to the utility obtained from the purchase of commodities with one rupee"
6747,"in particular, the condition (a) says that the marginal utility of a product in terms of money should be equal to its price"
6748,"sometimes, this is loosely stated as marginal utility is equal to price, i.e"
6749,"-> if mu > price -> as a rational consumer, he keeps on going to purchase an additional unit of a commodity as long as mu = price"
6750,-> mu > price implies when benefit is greater than cost and whenever benefit is greater than cost a consumer keeps on consuming additional unit of a commodity till mu = price
6751,"-> it is so because according to the law of diminishing marginal utility, mu falls as more is purchased"
6752,"as mu falls, it is bound to become equal to the price at some point of purchase"
6753,-> if mu< price -> as a rational consumer he would have to reduce the consumption of a commodity as long as mu=price
6754,"-> mu < price implies when benefit is less than cost and whenever benefit is less than cost, consumer keeps on decreasing the additional unit of a commodity till mu = price"
6755,"-> it is so because according to the law of diminishing marginal utility, mu rises as less units are consumed"
6756,"as mu rises, it is bound to become equal to the price at some point of purchase"
6757,• sufficient condition: total gain falls as more is purchased after equilibrium
6758,it means that consumer continues to purchase so long as total gain is increasing or at least constant
6759,"-> it can be explained with the help of the following schedule and diagram: suppose, the price of commodity x in the market is rs.3 per unit"
6760,"suppose, the utility obtained from the first unit is 5 utils (= rs.5)"
6761,the consumer will buy this unit because the utility of this unit is greater than the price
6762,whether the consumer consumes second unit or not depends on the utility obtained from the second unit
6763,"again, suppose the utility of the third unit is 3 utils (= rs.3)"
6764,since the utility equals to price he will buy the third unit also
6765,consumer will not buy the fourth unit because utility of this unit is 2 utils (= rs.2) which is less than the price
6766,the difference between utility and price of a unit of a commodity represents the gain to the consumer from that unit
6767,"for example, utility of first unit of x is rs.5 and price paid is rs.3, the gain is rs.2 (= 5 – 3)"
6768,"similarly, gain from the second unit is rs.1 and from the third unit is zero"
6769,the total gain from the three units is rs.3 (= 2 + 1 + 0)
6770,total gain from 4 units is rs.2 (= 2 + 1 + 0 – 1)
6771,the conclusion is that in a single commodity case a consumer makes purchases only upto the point where mu = price
6772,"in the above diagram, consumption (demand) is recorded on the horizontal axis and marginal utility (price) is recorded on the vertical axis"
6773,it is because it is assumed that there is inverse relation between consumption and marginal utility
6774,mu is measured in terms of rupee and it is assumed marginal utility in terms of one rupee (mur)
6775,"according to the theory, the consumer compares mu (the benefit) with the price (the cost) and makes purchase upto the mu = price level"
6776,"if we assume that market price is₹3 per unit, the consumer will buy exactly 3 units"
6777,in a single commodity case a consumer is in equilibrium when marginal utility equals to the price
6778,"-> if marginal utility of rupee is not equal to one, then the consumer equilibrium with the help of schedule is: suppose that the price of apple is 8 and marginal utility of a rupee is 3 utils"
6779,it is clear from the above schedule that initially mu in terms of money is greater than the price of apple
6780,"for example, from consumption of the first apple, the consumer gets utility equal to 30 utils or utility worth rs.10 (= 30 + 3) whereas he sacrifices utility of ?8 in the form of price"
6781,"thus, he gets benefit of rs.2 (= 10 – 8) from the first apple"
6782,"making such comparisons for successive units till the consumption level of the 3rd unit at which mu in terms of money (i.e., 8) becomes equal to its price (i.e., 78)"
6783,"thus, at the level of 3 apples, the consumer reaches the state of equilibrium because the above mentioned condition of equilibrium mu = p_ is met here"
6784,-> derivation of demand curve through the mu = price for single commodity consumer equilibrium: as we know a consumer purchases a good up to the point where marginal utility of the good becomes equal to the price of that good
6785,"mu = price now, suppose that the price of the good falls and therefore, it becomes lower than the mu"
6786,"mu > price since mu is greater than the price, it means benefit is greater than the cost"
6787,it will induce the consumer to buy more units of the goods
6788,"it shows that when price of goods falls, its demand rises and the consumer will continue to buy more units until mu falls enough to be equal to the price again"
6789,it can be explained with the help of the diagrams given on next page
6790,it can be seen from the given diagrams that figure b is derived from figure a
6791,"in figure a, initially, consumer equilibrium is attained at point e, where mu (10) = price (10)"
6792,"corresponding to point e, we derive point e1 in figure b"
6793,"due to fall in price (suppose from 10 to 8), mu > price at the given quantity"
6794,"so, we can say that benefit is greater than cost and the consumer increases the quantity till mu = price condition is attained at f"
6795,"corresponding to point f, we derive the point f1( in figure b"
6796,"so, by joining point e1 and f1 together, we derive the demand curve"
6797,-> given above is the utility schedule of a consumer for commodity x
6798,(assume that utility is expressed in utils and 1 util = rs
6799,"we know that the equilibrium condition for a consumer, in case of a single commodity, is condition is satisfied, if the consumer purchases 4 units"
6800,"(at this level, mux = 6 utils, mur = 1 and px = rs"
6801,the consumer will purchase 4 units as mu is equal to price at the 4th unit
6802,the consumer will not purchase less than 4 units as mu will be greater than the price and there will be scope for increasing the total satisfaction by purchasing more units
6803,"if the consumer buys more than 4 units, mu becomes less than the price is paid"
6804,"(b) two commodities consumer equilibrium (law of equi-marginal utility or law of substitution or gossen’s second law or law of maximum satisfaction) (i) according to the two commodities consumer equilibrium or law of equi-marginal utility, a consumer gets maximum satisfaction, when ratios of mu of two commodities and their respective prices are equal"
6805,(ii) conditions of consumer’s equilibrium in case of two commodities: necessary condition: marginal utility of last rupee spent on each commodity is same
6806,"in other words, marginal utility falls as more and more units of a commodity are consumed"
6807,"this condition must be satisfied to attain the necessary condition, similarly, for commodity y, the condition is, putting equation (2) in (1), we get mux, muy x is more than marginal utility from the last rupee spent on commodity y"
6808,"so, to attain the equilibrium consumer must increase the quantity of x, which decrease the mux and decrease the quantity of y which will increase the muy"
6809,increase in quantity of x and decrease in quantity of y continue till commodity x is less than marginal futility from the last rupee spent on commodity y
6810,"so, to attain the equilibrium the consumer must decrease the quantity of x, which will increase the mux and increase the quantity of y, which will decrease the mu"
6811,decrease in quantity of x and increase in quantity of y continues till mux=muy
6812,"the consumer will spend all his income on one commodity, which is highly unrealistic"
6813,"suppose, total money income of the consumer is rs.6 which he wishes to spend on two commodities: ‘x’ and ‘y’ both these commodities are priced at rs.1 per unit"
6814,"so, the consumer can buy the maximum 6 units of ‘x’ or 6 units of ‘y’"
6815,"in table given below, has shown the marginal utility which the consumer derives from the various units of ‘x’ and ‘y’"
6816,"in the diagram, mu from commodity ‘x’ is taken on oy axis and mu of commodity ‘y’ on o1y1 axis"
6817,mux and muy are the marginal utility curves for commodities ‘x’ and ‘y’ respectively
6818,"from the above table and figure, it is obvious that the consumer will spend the first rupee (shown in brackets) on commodity ‘x’, which will provide him utility of 26 utils"
6819,"the second rupee and the third rupee will again be spent on commodity ‘x, which gives him the utility of 24 utils and 22 utils respectively"
6820,"the fourth rupee will be spent on commodity y, which gives him the utility of 21 utils"
6821,"to reach the equilibrium, consumer should purchase that combination of both the goods, in which mu of ‘x’ and ‘y’ are equal, i.e"
6822,mux = muy (as prices of both the goods are same)
6823,"it happens at point ‘e’, when mu of 5th rupee spent on ‘y’ and mu of 6th rupee spent on ‘x’ or mu of 5th rupee spent on ‘x’ and mu of 6th rupee spent on ‘y’ are the same, i.e"
6824,20 utils of 133 utils will be obtained by spending his income of rs
6825,"if the consumer spends his income in any other order, total satisfaction will be less than 133 utils"
6826,-> derivation of demand curve for two commodities consumer equilibrium: the law states that a consumer is in equilibrium when the ratio of mu to price in case of each good consumed is the same
6827,"in two goods, x and y, a consumer is in equilibrium when, given that the consumer is in equilibrium and price of x falls"
6828,due to this change equilibrium equality converts into the following inequality
6829,"it means, marginal utility from the last rupee spent on commodity x is more than marginal utility from the last rupee spent on commodity y"
6830,"so, to attain the equilibrium the consumer must increase the quantity of x, which decrease the mu"
6831,"and decrease the quantity of y, which will increase the mu"
6832,increase in quantity of x and decrease in quantity of y continue till it can be seen from the above diagrams that figure b is derived from figure a
6833,"in figure a, initially, the consumer equilibrium is attained at point e, where =(assuming, px = 10)"
6834,"corresponding to point e, we derive point e: in figure b"
6835,"due to fall in price (suppose from 10 to 8), quantity qx"
6836,"it means, marginal utility from the last rupee spent on commodity x is more than marginal utility from the last rupee spend on commodity y"
6837,"so, to attain the equilibrium the consumer must increase the quantity of x, which decreases the mux and decreases the quantity of y, which will increase the muy"
6838,increase in quantity of x and decrease in quantity of y continue till and the new consumer equilibrium will be attained at point f
6839,"corresponding to point f, we derive the point f ; in figure b"
6840,"so, by joining point e1 and f1; we derive the demand curve"
6841,"36 to spend on purchase of two commodities x and y, whose prices are rs"
6842,the marginal utilities of the two commodities to the consumer are given in table (a) and the marginal utilities of the last rupee on both commodities are given in table (b)
6843,36) and given prices of the commodities x and y (rs
6844,"3 per unit), we determine how the consumer allocates/distributes the total income on the purchase of both the goods"
6845,marginal utilities of the last rupee spent on each commodity are equal [mux/px= muy/py ] when the following combinations of x and y are purchased
6846,the consumer will however maximize his utility when he spends rs
6847,"36, on purchase of 3 units of x and 6 units of y"
6848,"thus, only when mux/px= muy/py = mum = 7 utils, that the consumer will be in equilibrium and maximize his utility"
6849,"the law of equi-marginal utility is also called the law of maximum satisfaction as the consumer maximizes his satisfaction, given the constraint of money income and prices of commodities"
6850,the consumer budget let us consider a consumer who has only a fixed amount of money (income) to spend on two goods the prices of which are given in the market
6851,the consumer cannot buy any and every combination of the two goods that she may want to consume
6852,the consumption bundles that are available to the consumer depend on the prices of the two goods and the income of the consumer
6853,"given her fixed income and the prices of the two goods, the consumer can afford to buy only those bundles which cost her less than or equal to her income"
6854,budget line (a) budget line is a graphical representation which shows all the possible combinations of the two goods that a consumer can buy with the given income and prices of commodities
6855,600 as his money income and decides to spend this entire income on the purchase of two commodities x1 and x2 where per unit price of x1 be rs
6856,5 and that of x2 rs.4 per unit and these prices remain unchanged during the period in which the consumer buys these commodities
6857,(c) if the consumer decides to spend his entire money income of rs
6858,"600 on the purchase of commodity xx, he can buy 120 units of x, and on purchase of x2 i"
6859,"e., 150 units of x2 (shown in given figure as point r and p)"
6860,points p and r are two extreme possibilities of the combination of that the can purchase with his given money income and prices of commodities
6861,"by joining points p and r, we can know all the possible combinations of two commodities x1 and x2, which can be purchased with rs.600"
6862,"thus, the budget line is the set of bundles that costs exactly m"
6863,"(d) the equation of budget line is: p1 x1+ p2 x2 = m …(1) where, p1 and p2 are the prices of two commodities: x1 and x2 are the quantities of two commodities p1 x1 is the expenditure on commodity x1 p2 x2 is the expenditure of on commodity x2 (e) budget constraint shows the combination of two commodities whose expenditure can be less than or equal to money income"
6864,p1 x1 + p2 x2 < m (f) budget set is the collection of all bundles of pieces of goods that a consumer can buy with his income at the prevailing market prices
6865,(g) market rate of exchange is the rate at which market requires to sacrifice one commodity to gain an additional unit of another commodity is called market rate of exchange
6866,let consumer’s money income is 10 and price of commodity 1 is 2 and price of commodity 2 is 1
6867,"i.e., m = 10, p, = 2 and p2 = 1"
6868,ordinal utility states that the satisfaction the consumer derived from the consumption of goods and services cannot be measured in numbers
6869,"rather, ordinal utility uses a ranking system in which a rank is provided to the satisfaction that is derived from consumption"
6870,"consumer’s preferences are assumed to be such that between any two bundles (x1,x2) and (y1,y2), if (x1,x2) has more of at least one of the good and no less of the other good as compared to (y1,y2), the consumer prefers (x1,x2) to (y1,y2)"
6871,"thus, a consumer’s preferences are monotonic if and only if between any two bundles the consumer prefers the bundle which has more of at least one of the pieces of good and no less of the other piece of good as compared to the other bundle"
6872,"for example, (x1[5], xy2[4]) bundle is monotonic preferred bundle to (y1[4], y2[4]) bundle because we have more quantity of one good i.e., 5(x1) > 4(y1) and no less quantity of other goods i.e., 4(x2) = 4(y2)"
6873,"similarly, (x1[5], x2[5]) bundle is monotonic preferred bundle to (y1[4], y2[4]) bundle because we have more pieces/quantities of both the goods i.e., 5(x1) > 4(y1) and 5(x2) > 4(y2)"
6874,"but the (x1[5], x2[3]) bundle is not monotonic preferred bundle to (y1[4], yy2[4]) bundle because we have more pieces of one good i.e., 5(x1) > 4(y1) and less of other good i.e., 3(x2) < 4(y2) and condition states that we have atleast more of one good and no less of other good, but in this case 3(x2) < 4(y2)"
6875,utility: utility is the power or capacity of a commodity to satisfy human wants
6876,cardinal utility: cardinal utility states that the satisfaction the consumer derives by consuming goods and services can be measured with number
6877,ordinal utility: ordinal utility uses a ranking system in which a rank is provided to the satisfaction that is derived from consumption
6878,total utility: total utility is the total psychological satisfaction a consumer obtains from consuming a given amount of a particular good
6879,marginal utility: marginal utility is the additional utility derived from consumption of an additional unit of a commodity
6880,law of diminishing marginal utility: it states that marginal utility derived from the consumption of a commodity declines as more units of that commodity are consumed
6881,consumer’s equilibrium: it refers to a situation where a consumer gets maximum satisfaction out of his given money income and given market price
6882,mu of one rupee: it refers to the utility obtained from purchase of commodities with one rupee
6883,budget line: budget line is a graphical representation which shows all the possible combinations of the two goods that a consumer can buy with the given income and prices of commodities
6884,budget constraint: it shows the combination of two commodities whose expenditure can be less than or equal to money income
6885,budget set: it is the collection of all bundles of pieces of goods that a consumer can buy with his income at the prevailing market prices
6886,market rate of exchange: the rate at which market requires to sacrifice one commodity to gain an additional unit of another commodity is called market rate of exchange
6887,"monotonic preferences: consumer’s preferences are assumed to be such that between any two bundles (x1, x2) and (y1 , y2), if (x1, x2) has more of at least one of the good and no less of the other good as compared to (y1 , y2), the consumer prefers (x1,x2) to (y1 , y2)"
6888,marginal rate of substitution: it is the rate at which a consumer is willing to sacrifice one commodity for an extra unit of another commodity without affecting his total satisfaction
6889,indifference curve: it refers to the graphical representation of various combinations of the goods that provide the same level of satisfaction to the consumer
6890,(c)(i)tr is summation of mr: total revenue can also be calculated as the sum of marginal revenues of all the units sold
6891,"it means, trn = mr1 + mr2 + mr3 +……….+ mrn (ii) 3"
6892,(a) the per revenue received from the sale of given amount of output is knows as average revenue
6893,"(b)as, sellers receive revenue according to price, price and ar are one and the same thing"
6894,"this can be explained as under, (c) for example, (i) if total revenue from the sale of 100 chairs at a price of rs"
6895,200 (ii) (d) a buyer’s demand curve graphically represents the quantities demanded by a buyer at various prices
6896,"in other words, it shows the various levels of average revenue at which different quantities of the goods are sold by the seller"
6897,"therefore, in economics, it is customary to refer ar curve as the demand curve of a firm"
6898,(a) marginal revenue is the additional revenue when an additional unit of output is sold
6899,(ii) (a) we know that mr is the change in tr when one more unit is sold
6900,"however, when change in units sold is more than one, then mr can also be calculated as change in total revenue atr change in number of units aq (b) for example: if the total revenue realised from sale of 100 chairs is rs"
6901,"30,000, the marginal revenue will be, (ii) relationship between revenue curves case i: relationship between average revenue and marginal revenue when price is constant 1"
6902,"when price remains the same at all output levels, the firm cannot influence the prevailing market price of the commodity"
6903,it can sell any amount of the commodity at this given price
6904,under such a case firm’s average and marginal revenue remains equal and their curves coincide as shown in given schedule and diagram: 3
6905,it can be seen from the above schedule and diagram that price remains same and equal to mr at all levels of output
6906,"as the result of, demand curve (or ar curve) is perfectly elastic"
6907,"when a firm is able to sell more output at the same price, then ar = mr at all levels of output"
6908,case ii: relationship between total revenue and marginal revenue when price is constant 1
6909,"when price of the commodity is constant, then firms can sell any quantity of output at a given price"
6910,"so, mr curve (and ar curve) is a horizontal straight line parallel to the x-axis"
6911,"since mr remains constant, tr also increases at a constant rate (see schedule)"
6912,"due to this reason, the tr curve is a positively sloped straight line (see figure)"
6913,"as tr is zero at zero level of output, the tr curve starts from the origin"
6914,case iii: relationship between average revenue and marginal revenue when price falls 1
6915,"when price falls, with rise in output, then ar falls, mr also falls but at a much faster rate"
6916,"as a result, both ar and mr curves slope downwards from left to right"
6917,this can be explained with the help of given schedule and figure: 3
6918,"in the above schedule, both mr and ar fall with increase in output"
6919,"however, the fall in mr is double than that in ar, i.e., mr falls at a rate which is twice the rate of fall in ar"
6920,"as a result, mr curve is steeper than the ar curve"
6921,"when the ar curve is extended till point b, then mr curve cuts the x-axis exactly halfway between the point of origin (o) and point b, so that oa = ab"
6922,case iv: relationship between total revenue and marginal revenue when price falls 1
6923,"when mr falls and remains positive, than total revenue increase at a diminishing rate"
6924,"(a) as per schedule, till the 5th unit of output, mr falls but remains positive and, thus, tr increases at diminishing rate"
6925,"(b) in figure, the tr curve increases at a diminishing rate (till point p) as long as mr is positive (till point p1)"
6926,"(i) as per schedule, at the 6th unit, mr is zero and tr is at its maximum and constant"
6927,"(ii) in figure, when mr is zero (point p1), total revenue reaches its highest point (point p)"
6928,"(i) as per schedule, after 6th unit, mr not only falls, but also becomes negative due to which tr starts declining"
6929,"(ii) in figure when mr becomes negative (after point p1), then total revenue falls (after point p)"
6930,revenue: revenue of a firm refers to receipts from the sale of output in a given period
6931,total revenue: the total money receipt of a firm from the sale of given amount of output is known as total revenue
6932,average revenue: the per unit revenue received from the sale of given amount of output is known as average revenue
6933,marginal revenue: marginal revenue is the additional revenue when an additional unit of output is sold
6934,"(b) unbalanced budget: if the government expenditure is either more or less than a government receipts, the budget is known as unbalanced budget"
6935,"it may be of two types: (i) surplus budget (ii) deficit budget let us discuss them in detail: (i) surplus budget: if the revenue received by the general government is more in comparison to expenditure, it is known as surplus budget"
6936,"in other words, surplus budget implies a situation where government income is in excess of government expenditure"
6937,"(ii) deficit budget: if the expenditure made by the general government is more than the revenue received, then it is known as deficit budget"
6938,"in other words, in deficit budget, government expenditure is in excess of government income"
6939,"components of a government budget: government budget, comprises of two parts— (a) revenue budget and (b) capital budget"
6940,"(a) revenue budget: revenue budget contains both types of the revenue receipts of the government, i.e., tax revenue and non tax revenue ; and the revenue expenditure"
6941,(i) revenue receipts: these are the receipts that neither create any liability nor reduction in assets of the government
6942,"it includes tax revenues like income tax, corporation tax and non-tax revenue like fines and penalties, special assessment, escheat etc"
6943,(ii) revenue expenditure: an expenditure that neither creates any assets nor cause reduction of liability is called revenue expenditure
6944,(b) capital budget: capital budget contains capital receipts and capital expenditure of the government
6945,(i) capital receipts: government receipts that either creates liabilities (of payment of loan) or reduce assets (on disinvestment) are called capital receipts
6946,"capital receipts include items, which are non-repetitive and non-routine in nature"
6947,(ii) capital expenditure: this expenditure of the government either creates physical or financial assets or reduction of its liability
6948,"acquisition of assets like land, machinery, equipment, its loans and advances to state governments etc"
6949,budget receipts (government receipt): budget receipt refers to the estimated receipts of the government from various sources during a fiscal year
6950,it shows the sources from where the government intends to get money to finance the expenditure
6951,"budget receipts are of two types: (a) revenue receipts (i) meaning: • government receipts, which -> neither create any liabilities for the government; and -> nor cause any reduction in assets of the government, are called revenue receipts"
6952,• revenue receipts include items which are repetitive and routine in nature
6953,"(ii) revenue receipts are further classified into: • tax revenue: -> tax revenue refers to receipts from all kinds of taxes such as income tax, corporate tax, excise duty etc"
6954,-> a tax is a legally compulsory payment imposed by the government on income and profit of persons and companies without reference to any benefit
6955,• non-tax revenue: -> non-tax revenue refers to government revenue from all sources other than taxes
6956,"-> these are incomes, which the government gets by way of sale of goods and services rendered by different government departments"
6957,-> components of non-tax revenue: ♦ commercial revenue (profit and interest): ♦ it is the revenue received by the government by selling the goods and services produced by the government agencies
6958,"♦ for example, profit of public sector undertakings like railways, bhel, lic etc"
6959,"♦ government gives loan to state government, union territories, private enterprises and to general public and earns interest receipts from these loans"
6960,♦ it also includes interest and dividends on investments made by the government
6961,♦ administrative revenue: the revenue that arises on account of the administrative function of the government
6962,this includes: ♦ fee: fee refers to a payment made to the government for the services that it renders to the citizens
6963,"such services are generally in public interest and fees are paid by those, who receive such services"
6964,"for example, passport fees, court fees, school fees in government schools"
6965,♦ license fee: license fee is a payment to grant a permission by a government authority
6966,"♦ fines and penalties for an infringement of a law, i.e., they are imposed on law breakers"
6967,"♦ special assessment: sometimes government undertakes developmental activities by which value of nearby property appreciates, which leads to increase in wealth"
6968,"so, it is the payment made by owners of those properties whose value has appreciated"
6969,"for example, if value of a property near a metro station has increased, then a part of developmental expenditure made by government is recovered from owners of such property"
6970,♦ forfeitures are in the form of penalties imposed by courts that a person needs to pay in the court of law for failing to comply with court orders
6971,♦ escheat refers to the claim of the government on the property of a person who dies without having any legal heir or without leaving a will
6972,"♦ external grants: government receives financial help in the form of grants, gifts from foreign governments and international organisations (imf, world bank)"
6973,"such grants and gifts are received during national crisis such as earthquakes, flood, war etc"
6974,"(b) capital receipts: (i) meaning: • government receipts, that either creates liabilities (of payment of loan) or reduce assets (on disinvestment) are called capital receipts"
6975,in capital receipts any one of the conditions must be satisfied
6976,"• capital receipts include items which are non-repetitive and non-routine in nature, (ii) components: • borrowing (domestic and external): borrowings are made to meet the financial requirement of the country"
6977,a government may borrow money: -> domestically: general public (by issuing government bonds in the open market)
6978,-> externally: rest of the world (foreign government and international institutions) • recovery of loans and advances: loans offered to others are assets of the government
6979,it includes recovery of loans granted by the central government to state and union territory governments
6980,it is a capital receipt because it reduces financial assets of the government
6981,"100 crore, the value of the government of india assets reduces to rs"
6982,"since, recovery of loan reduces the value of assets, it is termed as a capital receipts"
6983,"disinvestment means selling whole or a part of the shares (i.e., equity) of selected public sector enterprises held by government"
6984,"direct taxes: when (a) liability to pay a tax (impact of tax), and (b) the burden of that tax (incidence of tax), falls on the same person, it is termed as direct tax"
6985,a direct tax is paid directly by the same person on whom it has been levied
6986,"it means a tax in which impact and incidence of tax falls on the same persons, then it is termed as direct tax"
6987,"in other words, burden of a direct tax is borne by the person on whom it is imposed which means the burden cannot be shifted to others"
6988,"alternatively, the person from whom the tax is collected is also the person who bears the ultimate burden of the tax"
6989,income tax and corporate (profit) tax are most appropriate examples of direct tax
6990,"indirect tax: when (a) liability to pay a tax (impact of tax) is on one person; and (b) the burden of that tax (incidence of tax), falls on the other person, it is termed as indirect tax"
6991,"it means a tax in which impact and incidence of tax lie on two different persons, then it is termed as indirect tax"
6992,"in other words, indirect taxes are the taxes of whose burden can be shifted to others"
6993,"in case of an indirect tax, person first pays the tax but he is able to transfer the burden of the tax to others"
6994,"for instance, sales tax is an indirect tax because indirect tax is collected by government from the seller of the commodity who in turn realizes the tax amount from the buyer by including it in the price of the commodity"
6995,"other examples of indirect taxes are excise duty, custom duty, entertainment tax, service tax etc"
6996,progressive tax: a tax the rate of which increases with the increase in income and decreases with the fall in income is called a progressive tax
6997,"the higher is the income of a taxpayer, the higher is proportionate tax he pays"
6998,"for example, in india income tax is considered a progressive tax because its rate goes on increasing with the increase in annual income"
6999,"for example, presently (2012-2013) there is no tax up to annual income of rs"
7000,"2,00,000 but the.rate of income tax increases with the increase in incomes"
7001,proportional taxation: a tax is called proportional when the rate of taxation remains constant as the income of the taxpayer increases
7002,example: if tax rate is 10% and the annual income of a person is rs
7003,"3,00,000 per annum, then the tax liability will rise to rs"
7004,"in this case, burden of tax is more on the poor section as compared to rich section"
7005,"regressive tax: in a regressive tax system, the rate of tax falls as the tax base increases"
7006,"in this case, we find that (a) the amount of tax to be paid increases, and (b) the rate at which tax is to be paid falls"
7007,meaning: budget expenditure refers to the estimated expenditure of the government on its “development and non-development programmes or “plan and non-plan programmes during the fiscal year
7008,types: (a) plan and non-plan expenditure (b) revenue and capital expenditure (c) developmental and non-developmental expenditure (a) plan and non-plan expenditure: (i) plan expenditure: plan expenditure refers to that expenditure which is incurred by the government to fulfill its planned development programmes
7009,this includes both consumption and investment expenditure by the government or planning commission of a country
7010,(ii) non-plan expenditure: this refers to all such government expenditures which are beyond the scope of its planned development programmes
7011,"for instance, no government can escape from its basic function of protecting the lives and properties of the people"
7012,"for this government has to spend on police, judiciary, military etc"
7013,"in short, expenditure other than expenditure related to current five-year plan is treated as non-plan expenditure"
7014,(b) revenue and capital expenditure: (i) revenue expenditure: an expenditure that (a) neither creates any assets (b) nor causes any reduction of liability
7015,"examples of revenue expenditure are: salaries of government employees, interest : payment on loans taken by the government, pensions etc"
7016,"(ii) capital expenditure: an expenditure that either create assets for the government [equity or shares) of the domestic, or multinational corporations purchased by the government), or cause reduction in liabilities of the government, [repayment of loans reduces liability of the government)"
7017,in capital expenditure any one of the above conditions must be satisfied
7018,"thus, it refers to expenditure that leads to creation of assets and reduction in liabilities"
7019,"conclusion: a basic difference between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure is that the capital expenditure is incurred on creation or acquisition of assets, whereas, the revenue expenditure is incurred on rendering services"
7020,"for example: expenditure on construction of a hospital building is capital expenditure, but expenditure on medicines, salaries of doctors etc"
7021,(c) developmental and non-developmental expenditure: (i) developmental expenditure: developmental expenditure is the expenditure on activities which are directly related to economic and social development of the country
7022,"this includes expenditure on education, health, agriculture, transport, roads, rural development etc"
7023,this also includes loans given by the government to enterprises like sahara for the purpose of development
7024,(ii) non-developmental expenditure: non-developmental expenditure of the government is the expenditure on the essential general services of the government
7025,"this includes expenditure on defence, payment of old age pension, collection of taxes, interest on loans, subsidies etc"
7026,budget deficit: (a) meaning: (i) budgetary deficit refers to the excess of total budgeted expenditure (both revenue expenditure and capital expenditure) over total budgetary receipts (both revenue receipt and capital receipt)
7027,"(ii) in other words, when sum of revenue receipts and capital receipts fall short of the sum of revenue expenditure and capital expenditure, budgetary deficit is said to occur"
7028,"symbolically, budgetary deficit = total expenditure – total receipts (b) types: (i) revenue deficit, (ii) fiscal deficit and (iii) primary deficit 2"
7029,revenue deficit: (a) meaning: (i) revenue deficit refers to the excess of revenue expenditure of the government over its revenue receipts
7030,"symbolically, revenue deficit = total revenue expenditure – total revenue receipts (ii) the government of india budget for the year 2012-2013, total expenditure is rs"
7031,(b) implications of revenue deficit: (i) revenue deficit indicates dis-savings on government account because the government has to make up uncovered gap
7032,(ii) revenue deficit implies that the government has to cover this uncovered gap by drawing upon capital receipts either through borrowing or through sale of its assets
7033,"(iii) since government is using capital receipts to generally meet consumption expenditure of the government, it leads to an inflationary situation in the economy"
7034,(c) measures to reduce revenue deficit are: (i) government should reduce its unproductive or unnecessary expenditure
7035,(ii) government should increase its receipts from various sources of tax and non-tax revenue
7036,fiscal deficit: (a) meaning: (i) fiscal deficit is defined as excess of total expenditure over total receipts (revenue and capital receipts) excluding borrowing
7037,in the form of an equation: (ii) fiscal deficit is a measure of total borrowings required by the government
7038,(iii) fiscal deficit indicates capacity of a country to borrow in relation to what it produces
7039,"in other words, it shows the extent of government dependence on borrowing to meet its budget expenditure"
7040,"(iv) another point to be noted here is that as the government borrowing increases, its liability in future to repay loan with interest also increases leading to a higher revenue deficit"
7041,"(v) fiscal deficit for the year 2012-2013 is 4,89,890 crore which is 4.9% of gdp"
7042,(b) implications of fiscal deficit: (i) causes inflation: an important component of government borrowing includes borrowing from the reserve bank of india
7043,this invariably implies deficit financing or meeting deficit requirements of the government by way of printing more currency
7044,"this is a dangerous practice, though very convenient for the government"
7045,(ii) increase in foreign dependence: government also borrows from rest of the world
7046,foreign borrowing is often associated with economic and political interference by the lender countries
7047,(iii) financial burden for future generation: borrowing implies accumulation of financial burdens for the future generations
7048,it is for future generations to repay loans as well as the mounting interest thereon
7049,"(iv) deficits multiply borrowings: payment of interest increases revenue expenditure of the government, causing an increase in its revenue deficit"
7050,"thus, a vicious circle is set wherein the government takes more loans to repay earlier loans, which is called debt trap"
7051,primary deficit: (a) meaning: (i) primary deficit is defined as fiscal deficit minus interest payments
7052,"primary deficit = fiscal deficit – interest payments (ii) the government of india budget for the year 2012-2013, fiscal deficit is 4,89,890 crore and interest payment is 3,11,996 crore"
7053,"as a result, primary deficit is 1,77,894 crore, which is 1.8% of gdp"
7054,"(b) implications of primary deficit: while fiscal deficit shows borrowing requirement of the government for financing the expenditure inclusive of interest payments, primary deficit reflects the borrowing requirements of the government for meeting expenditures other than interest payments on earlier loans"
7055,government budget: a government budget is an annual financial statement showing itemwise estimates of expected revenue and anticipated expenditure during a fiscal year
7056,"balanced budget: if the government revenue is just equal to the government expenditure made by the general government, then it is known as balanced budget"
7057,"unbalanced budget: if the government expenditure is either more or less than a government receipts, the budget is known as unbalanced budget"
7058,"surplus budget: if the revenue received by the general government is more in comparison to expenditure, it is known as surplus budget"
7059,"deficit budget: if the expenditure made by the general government is more than the revenue received, then it is known as deficit budget"
7060,budget receipt: it refers to the estimated receipts of the government from various sources during a fiscal year
7061,budget expenditure: it refers to the estimated expenditure of the government on its “development and non-development programmes or “plan and non-plan programmes during the fiscal year
7062,"revenue budget: revenue budget contains both types of the revenue receipts of the government, i.e., tax revenue and non tax revenue ; and the revenue expenditure"
7063,"revenue receipts: government receipts, which (a) neither create any liabilities for the government; and (b) nor cause any reduction in assets of the government, are called revenue receipts"
7064,"tax revenue: tax revenue refers to receipts from all kinds of taxes such as income tax, corporate tax, excise duty etc"

7068,capital budget: capital budget contains capital receipts and capital expenditure of the government
7069,capital receipts: government receipts that either creates liabilities (of payment of loan) or reduce assets (on disinvestment) are called capital receipts
7070,capital expenditure: government expenditure of the government which either creates physical or financial assets or reduction of its liability
7071,"direct tax: when (a) liability to pay a tax (impact of tax), and (b) the burden of that tax (incidence of tax), falls on the same person, it is termed as direct tax"
7072,"indirect tax: when (a) liability to pay a tax (impact of tax) is on one person; and (b) the burden of that tax (incidence of tax), falls on the other person, it is termed as indirect tax"
7073,progressive tax: a tax the rate of which increases with the increase in income and decreases with the fall in income is called a progressive tax
7074,proportional taxation: a tax is called proportional when the rate of taxation remains constant as the income of the taxpayer increases
7075,"regressive tax: in a regressive tax system, the rate of tax falls as the tax base increases"

7077,non-plan expenditure: this refers to all such government expenditures which are beyond the scope of its planned development programmes
7078,developmental expenditure: developmental expenditure is the expenditure on activities which are directly related to economic and social development of the country

7081,revenue deficit: revenue deficit refers to the excess of revenue expenditure of the government over its revenue receipts
7082,fiscal deficit: it is defined as excess of total expenditure over total receipts (revenue and capital receipts) excluding borrowing
7083,fiscal deficit indicates capacity of a country to borrow in relation to what it produces
7084,"in other words, it shows the extent of government dependence on borrowing to meet its budget expenditure"
7085,"debt trap: a vicious circle set wherein the government takes more loans to repay earlier loans, which is called debt trap"
7086,primary deficit: it is defined as fiscal deficit minus interest payments
7087,"producer’s equilibrium when price is constant with a rise in output under mr/mc approach is determined where, (a) mr = mc (b) mc must be rising according to table, both the conditions of equilibrium are satisfied at 4 units of output"
7088,mc is more than mr when output is produced after 4 units of output
7089,"so, producer’s equilibrium will be achieved at 4 units of output"
7090,"however, mr is equal to mc at 2 units of output also"
7091,let us understand the determination of equilibrium o with the help of a diagram
7092,"producer’s equilibrium is determined at oq level of «p output corresponding to point e as at this point, mc mr and mc curve cuts mr curve from below"
7093,"in figure, output is shown on the horizontal axis and £ revenue and costs on the vertical axis"
7094,"producer’s q units sold equilibrium will be determined at oq level of output corresponding to point e because at this, the following two conditions are met: (a) mc = mr; (b) mc curve cuts the mr curve from below"
7095,"when mr > mc, then producer will continue to produce as long as mr becomes equal to mc"
7096,it is so because firm will find it profitable to raise the output level
7097,"when mr < mc, then producer will cut down the production as long as mr becomes equal to mc"
7098,it is so because firm will find it unprofitable to produce an extra unit
7099,"so, it starts reducing the level of output till mr = mc"
7100,"producer’s equilibrium when price fall with a rise in output under mr/mc approach is determined where, (a) mr = mc (b) mc must be rising when price falls with the rise in output, mr curve slope downwards"
7101,"let us understand this with the help of following table: according to table, both the conditions of equilibrium are satisfied at 4 units of output"
7102,mc is more than mr when output is produced after 4 units of output
7103,"so, producer’s equilibrium will be achieved at 4 units of output"
7104,"let us understand the determination of equilibrium ^ with the help of a diagram: producer’s equilibrium is determined at oq level of output corresponding to point e as at this point, mc = mr and mc curve cuts mr curve from below"
7105,"in figure, output is shown on the horizontal axis and revenue and costs on the vertical axis"
7106,"producer’s equilibrium will be determined at oq level of output g corresponding to point e because at this, the following two conditions are met: oq units sold (a) mc = m, and (b) mc curve cuts the mr curve from below"
7107,"when mr > mc, then producer will continue to produce as long as mr becomes equal to mc"
7108,it is so because firm will find it profitable to raise the output level
7109,"when mr < mc, then producer will cut down the production as long as mr becomes equal to mc"
7110,it is so because firm will find it unprofitable to produce an extra unit
7111,"so, it starts reducing the level of output till mr = mc"
7112,"so, the producer is at equilibrium at oq units of output"
7113,producer’s equilibrium: a producer is said to be in equilibrium when he produces that level of output at which his profits are maximum
7114,"(c) however, demand of the product is not in the control of monopoly firm"
7115,"in order to increase the output to be sold, monopolist will have to reduce the price because of price discrimination"
7116,"(d) therefore, a monopoly firm faces a downward sloping demand curve"
7117,(e) the elasticity of demand curve is inelastic because of no close substitute of a commodity
7118,shape of average revenue and marginal revenue curve under monopoly (a) a monopoly firm faces a downward sloping demand curve as more output can be sold only by reducing the price because of price discrimination
7119,"so, when price falls means average revenue falls and when average revenue fall, then marginal revenue also falls but at a much faster rate"
7120,meaning: (a) it refers to a market situation in which there are many firms which sell closely related but differentiated products
7121,"(b) market for such products are toothpaste, soap, air conditioners etc"
7122,(c) the market is called monopolistic competition since it contains both the competitive element and monopoly element
7123,"features of monopolistic competition (a) a large number of firms: (i) the number of firms selling similar product is fairly large, but not very large as in perfect competition"
7124,"(ii) as a result, firms are in a position to influence the price of their product due to their branji names"
7125,"(b) product differentiation: (i) in this type of market situation a producer can produce different products, but that products should be a close substitute to each other"
7126,"(ii) product differentiation means differentiating the product on the basis of brand, colour, shape etc"
7127,(iii) due to product differentiation each firm under monopolistic competition is in a position to exercise some degree of monopoly (inspite of large number of sellers) because buyers are willing to pay different prices for the same product produced by different firms
7128,"(iv) no doubt, producer has a control over a price, but he knows it very well to maximize the profit price has to be reduced"
7129,(c) selling cost: (i) it is the expenses which are incurred for promoting sales or inducing customers to buy a good of a particular brand
7130,"(ii) this includes the cost of advertisement through newspaper, television and radio, and cost on each other sales promotional activities"
7131,note: persuasive advertising: it refers to advertising so as to lure (attract) consumers avail from one brand to another
7132,"(d) free entry and exit of firms: (i) new firms can enter the market, if found profitable"
7133,"similarly, inefficient firms already operating in the market are free to quit the market if they incur losses"
7134,"(ii) it is because of this feature that like perfect competition, monopolistic competition also gives rise to normal profit"
7135,(iii) no firm receives abnormal profit in the long run as then new firms can emerge and old ones can expand output and adjust supply with changing demand
7136,"shape of demand curve under monopolistic competition (a) the demand curve faced by a firm is negatively slope, (i.e"
7137,"when price falls, demand rises) because the firm can sell more only by lowering the price of its product because of product differentiation"
7138,"(b) the demand curve in monopolistic competition is highly elastic due to availability of close substitutes as a result, ar curve becomes more flatter"
7139,"shape of average revenue and marginal revenue curve under monopolistic competition: (a) like a monopoly firm, the firm under monopolistic competition also fixed the price itself subject to certain limitations"
7140,"(b) no doubt, producer has a control over a price, but he knows it very well to maximize the profit, price has to be reduced"
7141,price reduce means average revenue reduces and average revenue reduces marginal revenue but at a much faster rate
7142,meaning: (a) the term oligopoly is derived from two greek words: ‘oligoi’ means few and ‘poleein’ means ‘to sell.’ (b) oligopoly is a market situation in which an industry has only a few firms (or few large firms producing most of its output) mutually dependent for taking decisions about price and output
7143,"(d) in india, markets for carbonated beverages, “national newspapers” market, mobile services provider, washing products, automobiles, cement, aluminium, etc., are the examples of oligopolistic market"
7144,in all these markets there are few firms for each particular product
7145,"types of oligopoly: (a) pure or perfect oligopoly: (i) in the case of pure oligopoly, firms produce homogenous products like copper, iron, steel and aluminium"
7146,"(ii) so, decisions by consumers to purchase the goods of a particular firm are influenced by the price considerations"
7147,"(b) imperfect or impure or differentiated oligopoly: (i) in differentiated oligopoly, firms produce differentiated products such as toilet soap, cigarettes or soft drinks"
7148,"(ii) the goods produced by different firms have their own distinguishing characteristics, but they are close substitutes of each other"
7149,"(c) collusive oligopoly: if the firms cooperate with each other in determining price or output or both, it is called collusive oligopoly or cooperative oligopoly"
7150,"(d) non-collusive oligopoly: if firms in an oligopoly market compete with each other, it is called a non-collusive or non-cooperative oligopoly"
7151,"features of oligopoly (a) few large sellers: (i) the number of sellers in an oligopoly market is small – when there are two or more than two, but not many sellers"
7152,(ii) what matters is that these few sellers account for most of the industry’s sales
7153,(iii) these “few” sellers consciously dominate the industry and indulge in intense competition
7154,each firm is aware of that it possesses a large degree of monopoly power
7155,"(iv) for example, the market for mobile service provider in india is an oligopolist structure as there are only few producers of mobile service provider"
7156,there exists severe competition among different firms and each firm tries to manipulate both prices and volume of production to outsmart each other
7157,(b) interdependence of decisions: (i) interdependence means that actions of one firm affects the actions of other firms
7158,"(ii) since the number of sellers is small, each firm has to take into consideration the possible reaction of its competitors, when making decisions"
7159,"(iii) the business decision of a single seller will have a substantial impact on the product price, output and profits of the rival firms"
7160,"(iv) for example in the “national newspapers” market, when the “economic times” introduced invitation pricing policy—they offered the newspaper at a price of rs.1.50 on weekdays"
7161,the hindustan times was forced to reduce its prices from rs
7162,"when hindustan times was celebrating its 75 years of service, they offered the newspaper at rs"
7163,(c) non-price competition: (i) oligopoly firms try to avoid price competition for the fear of price war
7164,"(ii) they use non-price competition methods like better services to customers, advertising, etc"
7165,(iii) oligopoly firms are in a position to influence the prices
7166,"however, they follow the policy of price stability or price rigidity"
7167,(iv) price rigidity refers to a situation in which whether there is change in demand and supply the price tends to stay fixed
7168,(v) if a firm tries to reduce the price the rivals will also react by reducing their prices
7169,"likewise, if it tries to raise the price, other firms will not do so"
7170,it will lead to loss of customers for the firm which intended to raise the price
7171,(d) barriers to the entry of firms: (i) the main reason why the number of firms is small is that there are barriers which prevent entry of firms into industry
7172,"(ii) patents, large capital, control over the crucial raw material etc., prevent new firms from entering into industry"
7173,(iii) only those who are able to cross these barriers are able to enter
7174,(e) role of selling costs: (i) due to severe competition and interdependence of the firms various sales promotion techniques are used
7175,(f) oligopoly firms may produce either a homogeneous or a differentiated product
7176,"(i) oligopoly firms may sell homogeneous products such as steel, aluminium, lpg cylinders etc"
7177,"they are called pure oligopolies, as the products of the respective firms are indistinguishable"
7178,(iii) in case of a pure oligopoly market situation rival firms will rely on “price” or “lowercosts” to compete in the market
7179,"(iv) on the other hand, in case of impure oligopolies, with firms producing differentiated products, firms can use “product variations” and “promotional” strategies to compete"
7180,"(g) group behaviour: (i) in an oligopoly situation, there are a few firms who control the entire market and each firm recognizes interdependence in their decision-making"
7181,"(ii) so, price-output decisions of a particular firm directly influence the competing firms"
7182,"(iii) instead of independent price and output strategy, oligopoly firms prefer group decisions that will protect the interest of all the firms"
7183,(iv) group behaviour means that firms tend to behave as if they were a single firm even though individually they retain their independence
7184,(h) indeterminate demand curve facing an oligopoly firm: (i) the most distinguishing feature of oligopoly is the “interdependence in decision making” of the rival firms
7185,(ii) the consequence of such interdependence is the high degree of uncertainty regarding the reaction pattern of rival oligopolists
7186,(iii) interdependence and uncertainly result in “indeterminateness of the demand curve” facing an oligopolist
7187,the firm cannot assume that his rivals will not react to its decision regarding change in its variables
7188,(iv) the demand curve facing an oligopoly firm keeps shifting as rival firms react to changes made by this firm
7189,monopoly: it is a market situation where there is a single firm selling the commodity and there is no close substitute of the commodity sold by the monopolist
7190,cartel: a cartel is a group of firms which jointly set output and prices so as to exercise monopoly power
7191,monopolistic competition: it refers to a market situation in which there are many firms which sell closely related but differentiated products
7192,"product differentiation: it means differentiating the product on the basis of brand, colour, shape etc"
7193,selling cost: it is the expenses which are incurred for promoting sales or inducing customers to buy a good of a particular brand
7194,persuasive advertising: it refers to advertising so as to lure consumers avail from one brand to another
7195,oligopoly: it is a market situation in which an industry has only a few firms (or few large firms producing most of its output) mutually dependent for taking decisions about price and output
7196,"pure or perfect oligopoly: in the case of pure oligopoly, firms produce homogenous products like copper, iron, steel and aluminium"
7197,"imperfect or differentiated oligopoly: in differentiated oligopoly, firms produce differentiated products such as toilet soap, cigarettes or soft drinks"
7198,"collusive oligopoly: if the firms cooperate with each other in determining price or output or both, it is called collusive oligopoly or cooperative oligopoly"
7199,(i) the mr and mc schedules (ii) the quantities for which the mr and mc are equal (iii) the equilibrium quantity of output and the equilibrium price of the commodity
7200,"(iv) the total revenue, total cost and total profit in equilibrium"
7201,"non-collusive oligopoly: if firms in an oligopoly market compete with each other, it is called a non-collusive or non-cooperative oligopoly"
7202,price rigidity: it refers to a situation in which whether there is change in demand and supply the price tends to stay fixed
7203,"(a) as we know, in perfect competition homogeneous goods are produced"
7204,"so, price remains constant, which makes the demand curve perfectly elastic"
7205,"(b) in perfect competition, homogeneous goods are produced, that is why price remains constant, as price = ar, it means ar remains constant"
7206,"and if, ar remains constant, then ar = mr as per the 8"
7207,"in perfect competition, industry is the price maker and firm is the price taker"
7208,"(a) as we know, in perfect competition, homogeneous goods are produced"
7209,"(b) so, industry will give that price to the firm where industry is in equilibrium, i"
7210,"(c) in the above diagram, price, revenue and cost is measured on vertical axis and units of commodity on horizontal axis"
7211,"industry will give op price to the firm as at that point demand = supply, i.e., industry is in equilibrium"
7212,the firms will follow the same price and charges same from the consumer
7213,"relationship between tr, ar and mr under perfect competition (a) in the perfect competition, a firm is a price taker"
7214,(fa) ) it has to sell its product at the same price as given (determined) by the industry
7215,"(c) hence, a firm’s ar and mr curve will be a horizontal straight line parallel to x axis"
7216,"(d) since price remains the same, i.e., mr is constant, therefore, tr increases at the constant rate as increase in the output sold"
7217,"(e) as a result, tr curve facing a competitive firm is positively sloped straight line"
7218,"again, because at zero output total revenue is zero therefore, tr curve passes through the origin o as shown in the 10"
7219,break-even point (a) break-even point is the level of output at which total cost of production (fixed cost + variable cost) per unit just equals to total revenue
7220,(b) at this point the firm has neither profit nor loss
7221,"in other words, firm gets only normal profit, which is included in total cost"
7222,"(c) normal profit is a minimum profit, that a firm must get to remain in production"
7223,shutdown point: shutdown point is a point where a firm is indifferent between whether to produce or shutdown
7224,"in other words, it is a situation when a firm is able to cover its variable costs only"
7225,the condition of shutdown point is: price = minimum of savc (short run average variable cost) multiply by output price x output = savc x output tr = tvc words that matter 1
7226,market: it refers to a region where the buyers and sellers of a commodity come in contact with each other to effect the transactions of purchase and sale of the commodity
7227,market structure: it refers to number of firms and types of firms operating in the industry
7228,perfect competition: it refers to a market situation in which buyers and sellers operate freely and a commodity sells at a uniform (constant) price
7229,"homogeneous products: product sold in the market are homogeneous, i.e., they are identical in all respects like quality, colour, size, weight, design, etc"
7230,break-even point: it is the level of output at which total cost of production (fixed cost + variable cost) per unit just equals to total revenue
7231,shutdown point: it is a point where a firm is indifferent between whether to produce or shutdown
7232,"in other words, it is to a situation when a firm is able to cover its variable costs only"
7233,"(b) (i) in the given diagram, price is measured on vertical axis, whereas quantity : demanded and supply is measured on horizontal axis"
7234,(ii) suppose that initially the price in the market is p1
7235,"at this price, the consumer demand p1b and the producer supply p1a, i.e"
7236,consumers want more than what the producer are willing to supply
7237,"so, price cannot stay on p1 as excess demand will create competition among the buyers and push the price up till we reach equilibrium"
7238,due to rise in price from p1 to p2 there is upward movement along the supply curve (expansion in supply) from a to e and upward movement along the demand curve (contraction in demand) from b to e
7239,"there is excess supply, equal to kl, which will create competition among the sellers and lower the price"
7240,the price will keep falling as long as there is an excess supply
7241,due to fall in price from p2 to p there is downward movement along the supply curve (contraction in supply) from l to e and downward movement along the demand curve (expansion in demand) from k to e
7242,(iv) the situation of zero excess demand and zero excess supply defines market equilibrium (e)
7243,"alternatively, it is defined by the equality between quantity demanded and quantity supplied"
7244,the price p is called equilibrium price and quantity q is called equilibrium quantity
7245,effect of change in equilibrium due to increase and decrease in demand and supply case i: increase in demand 1
7246,"an increase in demand leads to rightward shift of demand curve as shown in the figure below: you must know when demand increases, then shifting should be such that initial price remains constant"
7247,it is so because increase in demand is the part of the shift in demand in which other factor changes and price remains constant
7248,changes in demand (1) a to b because of increase in demand (shift in demand) (2) b to c as price rises because of excess demand which leads to upward movement along the demand curve
7249,a to c as price rises because of excess demand which leads to upward movement along the supply curve
7250,we assume that initial price is op and equilibrium quantity is oq as shown above: (a) in the above figure price is on vertical axis and quantity demanded and supplied is on horizontal axis
7251,but due to increase in demand due to the following reasons the demand curve shifts rightward from dd to d1d1
7252,(iii) income of a consumer rises in case of normal goods
7253,(iv) income of a consumer falls in case of inferior goods
7254,"(b) with new demand curve d1d1, there is excess demand at initial price op because at price op1 demand is pb and supply is pa, so there is excess demand of ab at price op"
7255,"(c) due to this excess demand, competition among the consumer will rise the price"
7256,"with the rise in price, there is upward movement along the demand curve (contraction in demand) from b to c and similarly, there is upward movement along the supply curve (expansion in supply) from a to c"
7257,"so, finally equilibrium price rises from op to op1, and equilibrium quantity also rises from oq to oq1 conclusion due to increase in demand, (i) equilibrium price rises from op to op1 (ii) equilibrium quantity also rises from oq to oq1 case ii: decrease in demand 1"
7258,"a decrease in demand leads to leftward shift of demand curve as shown in the below figure: you must know when demand decreases, then shifting should be such that initial price remains constant"
7259,it is so because decrease in demand is the part of the shift in demand in which other factor changes and price remains constant
7260,changes in demand (1) a to b because of decrease in demand (shift in demand) (2) b to c as price fall because of excess supply which leads to downward movement along the demand curve
7261,(a)a to c as price fall because of excess supply which leads to downward movement along the supply curve
7262,(iii) income of a consumer falls in case of normal goods
7263,(iv) – income of a consumer rises in case of inferior goods
7264,"(b) with new demand curve d1d1, there is excess supply at initial price op because at price op demand is pre and supply is pa so there is excess supply of ab at price op"
7265,"(c) due to this excess supply, competition among the producer will make the price fall"
7266,due to fall in price there is downward movement along the demand curve (expansion in demand) from b to c and similarly there is downward movement along the supply curve (contraction in supply) from a to c
7267,"so, finally, the equilibrium price falls from op to op1 and equilibrium quantity also falls from oq to oq1"
7268,"conclusion due to decrease in demand, (i) equilibrium price falls from op to op1"
7269,"an increase in supply leads to rightward shift of supply curve as shown in the below figure: you must know when supply increases, then shifting should be such that initial price remains constant"
7270,it is so because increase in supply is the part of the shift in supply in which other factor changes and price remains constant
7271,changes in supply (1) a to b because of increase in supply (shift in supply) (2) b to c as price falls because of excess supply which leads to downward movement along the supply curve
7272,a to c as price falls because of excess supply which leads to downward movement along the demand curve
7273,we assume that initial price is op and equilibrium quantity is oq as shown above: (a) in the above figure price is on vertical axis and quantity demanded and supplied is on horizontal axis
7274,but due to increase in supply due to the following reasons: (i) fall in the prices of remuneration of factors of production
7275,(iv) change in objective of producer (inducing them to increase supply at the same price.) (v) taxation policy of government falls
7276,"with new supply curve s, s,, there is excess supply at initial price op because at price op1 supply is pb and demand is pa, so there is excess supply of ab at price op"
7277,(c) due to this excess supply competition among the producer will make the price fall
7278,"due to this fall in price there is downward movement along the supply curve (contraction in supply) from b to c and similarly, there is downward movement along the demand curve (expansion in demand) from a to c"
7279,"so, finally, equilibrium price falls from op to op1 and equilibrium quantity rises from oq to oq1 conclusion due to increase in supply, (i) equilibrium price falls from op to op1"
7280,"case iv: decrease in supply a decrease in supply leads to leftward shift of supply curve as shown in the below figure: you must know when supply decreases, then shifting should be such that initial price remains constant"
7281,it is so because decrease in supply is the part of the shift in supply in which other factor changes and price remains constant
7282,changes in supply (1) a to b because of decrease in supply (shift in supply) (2) b to c as price rises because of excess demand which leads to upward movement along the supply curve
7283,changes in demand a to c as price rises because of excess demand which leads to upward movement along the demand curve
7284,we assume that initial price is op and equilibrium quantity is oq as shown above: (a) in the above figure price is on vertical axis and quantity demanded and supplied is on horizontal axis
7285,but due to decrease in supply due to the following reasons the supply curve shifts leftward from ss to s1s1
7286,(i) rise in the prices of remuneration of factors of production
7287,(iv) change in objective of producer (inducing them to decrease supply at the same price)
7288,"(b) with new supply curve s1s1 , there is excess demand at initial price op because at price op, supply is pb and demand is pa, so there is excess demand of ab at price op"
7289,(c) due to this excess demand competition among the consumer will rise the price
7290,"due to this rise in price there is upward movement along the supply curve (expansion in supply) from b to c and similarly, there is upward movement along the demand curve (contraction in demand) from a to c"
7291,"so, finally, equilibrium price rises from op to op1 and equilibrium quantity falls from oq to oq1"
7292,"conclusion due to decrease in supply, (i) equilibrium price rises from op to op1 (ii) equilibrium quantity falls from oq to oq1 simultaneously increase and decrease in demand and supply case i: both demand and supply increases: when both demand and supply increases, then there are three possibilities: case a: when demand and supply both increase at the same rate 1"
7293,"when demand and supply both increase at the same rate, equilibrium price remains constant and equilibrium quantity rises"
7294,it can be shown with the help of the following diagram
7295,"case b: when demand and supply both increase at the same rate, then equilibrium price remains constant"

7305,"logic suppose demand and supply both decrease by 5%, then there is neither excess demand nor excess supply, i.e., why price remains constant"
7306,we assume that initial price is op and equilibrium quantity is oq as shown above: (a) in the above diagram price is measured on vertical axis and quantity demanded and supplied is measured on horizontal axis
7307,"(b) but when “demand and supply both decrease at the same rate” then, (i) equilibrium price remains constant at op1 and (ii) equilibrium quantity falls from oq to oq1"

7329,"(d) when the government fixes the price of a commodity at a level lower than the equilibrium price (say it fixes the price at op1, there would be a shortage of the commodity in the market"
7330,"there is, thus, a shortage of rs quantity at this price (i.e., op1)"
7331,"in free market, this excess demand of rs would have raised the price to the equilibrium level of op"
7332,"(e) though the intension of the government was to help the consumers, it would end up creating shortage of wheat"
7333,"(f) to meet this excess demand, government may use rationing system"
7334,"(g) under rationing system, a certain part of demand of the consumers is met at a price lower than the equilibrium price"
7335,"under this system, consumers are given ration coupons/ cards to buy an essential commodities at a price lower than the equilibrium price from fair price/ration shop"

7434,"growing of crops, raising livestock, forestry and fishing all come under agricultural activities"
7435,there are mainly two types of farming techniques: subsistence farming commercial farming
7436,"when a farmer tills the land till the soil loses its fertility and then shifts to another fertile land, then this type of farming is known as shifting cultivation"
7437,the efforts made to increase farm production in order to meet the growing demands of the increasing population is known as agricultural development
7438,"we divide economic activities into three categories: primary, secondary and tertiary"
7439,"agriculture, an activity that is related directly to the extraction and production of natural resources, is a primary activity"
7440,"manufacturing of steel and baking of bread are secondary activities since they are not directly related to the extraction or production of natural resources, but their utilisation"
7441,transport and trade are tertiary activities since they do not come in either category
7442,"some of the important inputs required in agriculture are seeds, fertilisers, machinery and labour"
7443,two main types of farming practised are subsistence farming and commercial farming
7444,subsistence farming is practised solely to meet the needs of the farmer’s family
7445,use of modern technology is minimum and most work is done by household labour
7446,"in intensive subsistence agriculture, simple tools and huge labour are used by a farmer to cultivate a small plot of land"
7447,"this form of agriculture is seen in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, south-east and east asia"
7448,"in this, a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them"
7449,the ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown
7450,"after some time, the land is abandoned and the farmers move to a different place"
7451,"this type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the amazon basin, tropical africa, parts of south-east asia and north-east india"
7452,nomadic herding refers to the practice in which herdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water
7453,"commercial farming is the practice in which crops are grown exclusively for commercial purpose, i.e"
7454,a large area is cultivated and huge capital is involved unlike subsistence farming
7455,"the temperate grasslands of north america, europe and asia are some common areas where it is seen"
7456,the land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock
7457,"some areas where it is followed are europe, eastern usa, argentina, south-east australia, new zealand and south africa"
7458,"plantations are a type of commercial farming where only a single crop (like tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton) is grown"
7459,the produce is processed in the farm itself or nearby factories
7460,china and india are the largest producers of rice in the world
7461,"in addition, it needs moderate temperature and rainfall during growing season and bright sunshine at harvesting"
7462,"maize requires moderate temperature, rainfall, good sunshine and well-drained fertile soils"
7463,"it needs high temperature, light rainfall, 210 frost free days and bright sunshine"
7464,agricultural development refers to the effort to increase farm production so as to meet growing demand of increasing population
7465,"mechanisation, a part of agricultural development, means using more machines than human labour"
7466,"a typical indian farm is about 1.5 hectares in area, whereas a typical usa farm is about 250 hectares"
7467,mechanisation is not seen much in india as compared to usa
7468,"a farmer in india generally works as a “peasant” whereas in the usa, he works as a complete businessman"
7469,secondary activities: activities which are concerned with the processing of natural resources are called secondary activities
7470,tertiary activities: activities which fall neither in the primary category nor the secondary category are called tertiary activities

8024,these measures led to the serious shortage of pastures as grazing lands were turned into cultivable land
8025,the shepherds and cattle herds could no longer freely graze their cattle in the forests
8026,nomadic people had to move frequently from one place to another in search of pastures
8027,the animal stock declined as underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines
8028,ways by which pastoralists cope with the changes pastoralists coped up with the changes in a variety of ways some reduced the number of cattle in their herds since there was not enough pasture to feed large numbers
8029,some discovered new pastures when a movement to old grazing grounds became difficult
8030,"over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and settling down, giving up their nomadic life"
8031,"some of them became labourers, working on fields or in small towns"
8032,"in spite of such difficulties, pastoralist communities still exist and are considered the most important form of life ecologically"
8033,pastoralism in africa africa is a country where over half the world’s pastoral population lives
8034,"even now, over 22 million africans depend on some forms of pastoral activities for their livelihood"
8035,"the different pastoral communities of africa are bedouins, berbers, maasai, somali, boran and turkana"
8036,most of them lived in semi-arid grasslands where rainfed agriculture is difficult
8037,"others combine pastoral activity with agriculture field and still, others do a variety of odd jobs"
8038,the life of maasai community the maasai are nomadic and pastoral people who depend on milk and meat for subsistence
8039,"before colonial rules, maasailand stretched over a vast area from north kenya to the steppes of northern tanzania"
8040,"in the late 19th century, european imperial powers divided the region into different colonies"
8041,"after colonial rule, best grazing lands of maasai community were gradually taken over for white settlement and the maasai were pushed into a small area in southern kenya and northern tanzania"
8042,maasai believed that tilling the land for crop farming is a crime against nature
8043,"once you cultivate the land, it is no longer suitable for grazing"
8044,"effects of colonial ryle on naassi community maasais lost their grazing lands from the late 19 th century, the british colonial government in east africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand cultivation"
8045,the maasai community lost about 60% of their land and were confined to an arid zone with uncertain rainfall and poor pastures
8046,"in pre-colonial times, the maasai pastoralists had dominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and politically"
8047,"by the end of colonial rule, the situation became the opposite"
8048,"in 1885, maasailand was cut into half with an international boundary between british kenya and german tanganyika"
8049,they lost their grassing lands in the following ways large areas of grazing land were turned into game reserves like the maasai mara and samburu national park in kenya and serengeti park in tanzania
8050,"the serengeti national park has created over 14,760 km of maasai grazing land"
8051,"without grass, livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) were malnourished, which meant less food available for families and their children"
8052,the kilimanjaro water project cuts through the communities of the area near amboseli national park
8053,but the villagers are barred from using the water for irrigation or for livestock
8054,the loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created a serious problem for the pastoralists
8055,feeding the cattle became a persistent problem due to the unavailability of enough grazing lands
8056,effect of closed borders on pastoralists pastoral groups were forced to live within the confines of special reserves
8057,the boundaries of these reserves became the limits within which they could now move
8058,they were not allowed to move out with their stock without special permits
8059,they were not even allowed to enter the markets in white areas
8060,the new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists
8061,"earlier, pastoralists not only looked after animal herds but traded in various products"
8062,the restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading activities but they were now subject to various restrictions
8063,effect of dried pastures on maasais the maasais were forced to live in semi-arid tracts prone to frequent drought
8064,"since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were available, large numbers of maasai cattle died of starvation and disease in these years of drought"
8065,the colonial rules had unequal effects on elders and warrior groups of maasai society
8066,the elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes
8067,"the warriors consisted of young people, mainly responsible for the protection of the tribe"
8068,the warrior class proved their manliness by raiding the cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars
8069,"thus, the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was negatively affected"
8070,the chiefs appointed by the colonial government accumulated wealth over time
8071,"they had regular income with which, they could buy animals, goods and lands"
8072,they lent money to poor neighbours who needed it to pay taxes
8073,their family stayed back in villages to look after lands and animals
8074,these rich chiefs managed to survive devastations due to war and drought
8075,"the poor pastoralists did not have the resources to tide over bad times and thus, they were compelled to do odd jobs, like charcoal burners, workers in road and building construction, etc"
8076,"rituals to become maasai warrior even today, maasai young men go through an elaborate ritual before they become warriors, although actually it is no longer common"
8077,"they must travel throughout the section’s region for about 4 months, ending with an event where they run to the homestead and enter with an attitude of a raider"
8078,"during the ceremony, boys dress in loose clothing and dance non-stop throughout the day"
8079,"kaokoland herders of namibia in namibia, in south-west africa, the kaokoland herders traditionally moved between kaokoland and nearby ovamboland and they sold skin, meat and other trade products in neighbouring markets"
8080,all this was stopped with the new system of territorial boundaries that restricted movements between regions
8081,"in most places in colonial africa, the police were given instructions to keep a watch on the movements of pastoralists and prevent them from entering white areas"
8082,conclusion pastoral communities in different parts of the world are affected in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern world
8083,new laws and new borders affect the patterns of their movement
8084,"they change the path of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas"
8085,"they exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources"
8086,they are not people who have no place in the modern world
8087,environmentalists and economists have increasingly come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world
8088,pastoralism is a way of keeping animals and moving from one place to another to find water and food
8089,gujjar bakarwals migrated in the 19th century to kashmir crossing pir panjal
8090,they shifted their grazing lands from highlands in summer to lower hills of siwalik range in winter
8091,gaddi shepherds of himachal pradesh like gujjar bakarwals used to come down to the dry forest of bhabhar in winter and went up to the high meadows of bugyals in summer
8092,shearing of wool is being done at uhl valley near palampur in himachal pradesh
8093,"to adjust to seasonal changes and make proper use of available pastures bhotiyas, sherpas and kinnauris also involved in cyclic movement between summer and winter"
8094,"dhangars.of central plateau, maharashtra were mainly shepherds, blanket weavers and buffalo herders"
8095,"after harvesting bajra, they move towards konkan to reap benefits of high rainfall and rich soil"
8096,"gollas, kurumas and kurubas are cattle herders of dry central plateau qf karnataka and andhra pradesh"
8097,"cyclic movement of pastoralist communities in plateaus, plains and desert was defined by alteration of monsoon and dry season"
8098,"banjara tribes were found in villages of uttar pradesh, punjab, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and maharashtra, who also moved over long distance in search of pastures"
8099,raikas of rajasthan had to combine cultivation with pastoralism when sindh became part of pakistan after 1947
8100,maru raikas of jaisalmer lived in a settlement called dhandi and know about their community from a genealogist
8101,"camel fairs were held in pushkar, balotra where maru raikas display their expertise in training camels"
8102,"pastoralists had to set up a relationship with farmers and combined a range of different activities like cultivation, trade and herding"
8103,"hence, they categorised forest into the reserved forest (no pastoral activity allowed) and protected forest (permit system prevailed)"
8104,"criminal tribe act of 1871 classified many communities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists as criminal tribes"
8105,"british government introduced grazing tax, which was auctioned out to contractors"
8106,the changes brought by laws of british government reduced the available area for pastureland
8107,thus continuous grazing in the same piece of land degraded the quality of pasture
8108,"to adapt to the changing circumstances, pastoralists reduced the number of cattle, discovered new pasture"
8109,pastoralism is still considered an ecologically most viable form of life
8110,"pastoral communities like bedouins, berbers, maasai, somali, boran and tukana lived here"
8111,"the maasai community lost about 60% of their land and were confined to arid zones due to colonial laws, even though they dominated in economic and political fields in the pre-colonial era"
8112,territorial boundaries and restrictions were imposed on pastrolists and required the social permit to move out of it
8113,kaokoland herders of namibia were severely affected by these territorial boundaries
8114,elders were ruling community who settled disputes and decided on affairs of the community
8115,the warriors were young people who raided cattle and participated in wars
8116,but restrictions imposed’ by britishers affected the traditional authority of both elders and warriors
8117,though the traditional difference between elders and warriors was disturbed it did not breakdown
8118,with social change new distinction between wealthy and poor pastoralist developed
8119,the relevance of maasai tribe can be realised from the fact that even today young men go through an elaborate ritual before they become warriors
8120,the boys in the ceremony wear loose clothing and dance throughout the day
8121,pastoral communities are greatly affected by the new laws and new borders of the countries
8122,but they are not redundant communities rather recognised as the perfectly suitable communities for many hilly and dry regions by environmentalists and economists

8125,changes in forest societies under colonialism location of bastar people bastar rebellion forest rebellion in java world wars and deforestation
8126,"relationship between forest and livelihoods forests give us a mixture of things to satisfy our different needs — fuel, fodder, leaves, trees suitable for building ships or railways, trees that can provide hardwood"
8127,"forest products like roots, fruits, tubers, herbs are used for medicinal purposes, wood for agricultural implements like yokes, ploughs, etc"
8128,foresters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest should look like
8129,the forest department wanted trees which were suitable for building ships or railways
8130,they needed trees that could provide hardwood and were tall and straight
8131,"so particular species, like teak and sal, were promoted and others were cut"
8132,the new forest laws meant severe hardship for villagers across the country
8133,"after the act (forest act), all their everyday practices, cutting wood for their houses, grazing their cattle, collecting fruits and roots, hunting and fishing became illegal"
8134,"people were now forced to steal wood from the forests, and if they were caught they were at the mercy of the forest guards who would take bribes from them"
8135,it was also common for police constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding free food from them
8136,deforestation: deforestation is cutting down of trees indiscriminately in a forest area
8137,"as the population increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up, peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation by clearing forests"
8138,"the british encouraged the production of commercial crops like jute, sugar, wheat, and cotton for their industries as raw material"
8139,the british thought that forests were unproductive land as they yielded no revenue nor agricultural produce
8140,forest resources of india were used to make ships for the royal navy
8141,"the spread of railways required two things: land to be cleared to lay railway tracks, wood as fuel for locomotives and for railway line sleepers"
8142,"large areas of natural forests were cleared for tea, coffee, and rubber plantations"
8143,changes in forest societies under colonialism shifting cultivators: forest management had a great impact on shifting cultivators
8144,in shifting cultivation parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation
8145,they felt that such land could not be used for growing trees for railway timber and was dangerous while being burnt as it could start a forest fire
8146,this type of cultivation also made difficult for the government to calculate taxes
8147,nomadic and pastoralist communities: nomadic and pastoralist communities were also affected by changes in forest management
8148,their traditional customary grazing rights were taken away and their entry into the forests was restricted
8149,passes were issued to them which had details of their entry and exit into and out of the forests
8150,the days and hours they could spend in the forest were also restricted
8151,this was in contrast to the earlier system that allowed them unrestricted entry into forests
8152,pastoralists had to lessen the number of cattle in their herds which reduced their income
8153,"some pastoralists even had to change their lifestyle, leave pastoralism and work in mines, plantations, factories"
8154,firms trading in timber/forest products: firms trading in timber products were given the sole trading rights to trade in the forest products of particular areas
8155,plantation owners: plantation owners found that more and more forest land could be cleared for plantations
8156,"the british had made it very clear that their system of forestry would be scientific forestry, i.e., plantations"
8157,plantation owners began to reap profits as the british government gave large areas of forest land to european planters
8158,kings/british officials engaged in shikar: the kings/british officials engaged in shikar found that now the villagers were prohibited from entering the forests
8159,"thus, hunting increased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct"
8160,important dates 1600: approximately one-sixth of india’s landmass was under cultivation
8161,"1700-1995: 9.3% of the world’s total area was cleared for industrial uses, cultivation pastures and fuel wood"
8162,"1878: the indian forest act was amended and divided forests into reserved, protected and village forests"
8163,1890: surontiko samin started a movement against the state ownership of forests
8164,"1946: the length of railway tracks laid by now was over 765,000 km"
8165,1980: introduction of scientific forestry and restriction imposed on the forest communities resulted in many conflicts
8166,"location of bastar and believe of the people of bastar bastar is located in the southernmost part of chhattisgarh and borders andhra pradesh, odisha, and maharashtra"
8167,"a number of different communities live in bastar such as maria and muria gonds, dhurwas, bhatras and halbas"
8168,"the people of bastar believed that each village was given its land by the earth, and in return, they had to look after the earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival"
8169,"they show respect to the spirits of the river, the forest and the mountain"
8170,"since each village knows where its boundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources within that boundary"
8171,"if people from a village want to take some wood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called devsari, land or man in exchange"
8172,some villages also protect their forests by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain to pay them
8173,"every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of villages meet and discuss issues of concern, including forests"
8174,"causes for bastar rebellion when the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of the forest in 1905 and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection of forest produce, the people of bastar were very worried"
8175,"some villages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition that they worked free for the forest department in cutting and transporting trees, and protecting the forest from fire"
8176,people of other villages were displaced without any notice or compensation
8177,villagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent demands for free labour and goods by colonial officials
8178,then the terrible famines came in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908
8179,"results of the bastar rebellion in a major victory for the rebels, work on the reservation was temporarily suspended"
8180,the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that planned before 1910
8181,causes for forest rebellion in java the dutch wanted timber from java to build ships
8182,"the dutch enacted forest laws in java, restricting villagers’ access to forests"
8183,"now wood could only be cut for specified purposes like making riverboats or constructing houses, and only from specific forests under close supervision"
8184,"villagers were punished for grazing their cattle in young stands, transporting wood without a permit, or traveling on forest roads with horse carts or cattle"
8185,"as in india, the need to manage forests for shipbuilding and railways led to the introduction of a forest service by the dutch in java"
8186,the dutch first imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively to provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting timber
8187,"forest rebellion in java or saminist movement in java in the 1890s, surontiko samin a teak forest villager began questioning state ownership of the forest"
8188,"he argued that the state had not created the wind, water, earth, and wood, so it could not own it"
8189,"some of the sam insists protested by lying down on their land when the dutch came to survey it, while others refused to pay taxes or fines or perform labour"
8190,world wars and deforestation the first world war and the second world war had a major impact on forests
8191,"in india, working plans were abandoned at this time, and the forest department cut trees freely to meet british war needs"
8192,"in java, just before the japanese occupied the region, the dutch followed a ‘scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into japanese hands"
8193,"the japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their own war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests"
8194,"after the war, it was difficult for the indonesian forest service to get this land back"
8195,"as in india, people’s need for agricultural land had brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire to control the land and exclude people from it"

8289,"the mahanadi basin the mahanadi, a 860 km long river, rises in chhattisgarh to flow through orissa to reach the bay of bengal"
8290,"principal tributaries of mahanadi river are sheonath, jonk, hasdeo, mand, lb, ong and tel"
8291,"mahanadi river basin is shared by maharashtra, orissa, jharkhand and chhattisgarh"
8292,is is one of the major east flowing peninsular rivers draining into bay of bengal
8293,"the krishna basin the 1,400 km long krishna river rises from a spring in the mahadev range near mahabaleshwar and falls into the bay of bengal"
8294,"the tributaries of krishna include bhima, musi, ghatprabha, koyana and tungabhadra"
8295,"the krishna basin is shared by maharashtra, karnataka and andhra pradesh"
8296,"the narmada basin rising in the amarkantak plateau of maikala range, narmada flows to create a gorge in marble rocks of madhya pradesh"
8297,narmada flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting
8298,"the important ones are: barna, ganjal, chhota tawa, hiran, janatara, kolar, orsang, sher"
8299,"the tapi basin originating in betul, madhya pradesh, the tapi flows through a basin that covers madhya pradesh, gujarat and maharashtra"
8300,"the main west flowing rivers are sabarmati, mahi, bharatpuzha and periyar"
8301,"the entire tapi basin can be divided into three sub-basins: upper, middle and lower and into two well- defined physical regions, viz, the hilly regions and the plains or tapi basin"
8302,"the kaveri basin originating in the brahmagiri range of the western ghats, the kaveri reaches the bay of bengal at kaveripatnam, sharing its basin with karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala and puducherry or pondicherry"
8303,the main soil types found in the basin are red and yellow soils
8304,lakes most lakes are permanent while others contain water only during the rainy season
8305,"some lakes are the result of the glacial action and ice sheets and some may have been formed by wind, river action and human activities"
8306,a river meandering across a floodplain forms cut-offs that later develop into oxbow lakes
8307,glacial lakes are formed when glaciers dig out a basin which is later filled with snowmelt
8308,some lakes like wular lake in jammu and kashmir result from tectonic activity
8309,"apart from natural lakes, the damming of the rivers for the generation of hydel power has also led to the formation of lakes"
8310,"lakes help to regulate river water flow, prevent flooding, aid to develop hydel power, moderate climate, maintain aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty, develop tourism and provide recreation"
8311,role of rivers in the economy rivers are a natural source of water
8312,"rivers are used for irrigation, navigation, hydropower generation, all vital for india, and agricultural economy"
8313,"river pollution quality of river water is affected by the growing domestic, municipal, iftdustrial and agricultural demand"
8314,a heavy load of untreated sewage and industrial effluents are emptied into the river affecting the river’s self-cleansing property
8315,concern over rising pollution in our rivers led to the launching of various action plans to clean the rivers like narmada bachao movement

8318,size and distribution of population it refers to the total number of people in the country and where they are located
8319,population growth and process of population change it refers to how the population has grown and changes in its composition
8320,"characteristics of qualifies of life population it refers to age, sex-ratio, literacy levels, occupational structure, health conditions of people"
8321,"population size and distribution hie arrangement or a spread of people of a country in different places, is catted population distribution"
8322,size of population and its distribution can be studied under two heads- one population size and distribution by numbers and other in population distribution by density
8323,"india’s population size and distribution by numbers as per 2011 census, population of india stood at 1,210 million, which is  17.5% of the total world population."
8324,"it is unevenly distributed over the various states, with uttar pradesh having the highest population (199 million accounts for about 16.49 per cent of the countries population) and sikkim the lowest population (0.6 million accounts for about 0.05 per cent of the country’s population)"
8325,"among union territories, delhi has the highest (16.75 million) and lakshadweep the lowest (64,429) population"
8326,"almost half of india’s population lives in just five states cpmpfisiog uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, west bengal and andhra"
8327,"pradesh, while rajasthan being largest state accounted for only 6% of the total population"
8328,india’s population distribution by density the uneven population distribution can be better judged by the population density in the various states
8329,india is one of the most destiny populated countries in the world
8330,"after bangladesh and japan, it is the third most densely populated country"
8331,"india’s population density in 2001 was 324 persons per sq km (this increased to 382 persons per sq km in the 2011 census), with west bengal having the highest density of 904 persons per sq km and arunachal pradesh the lowest with only 13 persons per sq"
8332,"according to 2011 census, bihar has the highest population density 1,102 persons per sq km and arunachal pradesh having the lowest population density of 17 persons per sq km"
8333,"on the basis of population density inhale country is divided in to three regions high population density states these states are characterised by flat plains with fertile soils and abundant rainfall, e.g"
8334,"moderate population density states these states are characterised by hilly and rocky nature of terrain, moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soil"
8335,low population density states states with – low population density below 250 person per sq
8336,"km are characterised by rugged terrain (mountainous and desert) and unfavourable climatic condition, e.g"
8337,"[note: jelangema became the 29th state of india on the 2nd june 2014 after the reorganisation of the type of andhra pradesh.] population growth and processes of population change due to births, deaths and migrations the number, distribution and composition of population change continuously"
8338,population growth the change in the number of people of a country or state during a specific period of time is called growth of population
8339,"usually, it is mostly calculated at the interval of 10 years"
8340,the change can be expressed either in terms of absolute numbers or in terms of annual growth rate
8341,absolute increase of population it means the absolute numbers added each year or in each decade in the population
8342,annual growth rate of population the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increase in 1 year as a fraction of the initial population; is called annual growth rate of population
8343,"for example, a rate of increase of 2% per annum means that there was an increase of 2 persons for every 100 persons in the initial population"
8344,population growth rate since independence india’s annual growth rate of population increased steadily till 1981
8345,still the population growth of india in 1990s was 182 million (in terms of number)
8346,"inspite of decreasing annual growth rate (in percent), the largest addition in people(in terms of number) is due to the large population of the country"
8347,a low growth rate results a large absolute increase due to very high population
8348,"however, the declining growth rate is a positive indicator for the efforts of birth control but the total additions to the population continue to grow"
8349,"if this rate of increase continues, then india will surpass china by 2045 to become the most populous country in the world"
8350,"processes of population change/growth population changes due to the processes of births, deaths and migrations"
8351,the natural increase of population or the growth rate is the difference between birth rates and death rates
8352,birth rate the number of live births per thousand persons in a year is called birth rate
8353,"the birth rate is a major component of population growth as in india, it has been always higher than the death rate"
8354,death rate the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year is called death rate
8355,the main cause of the rate of growth of the indian population has been the rapid decline in death rates
8356,"there has been a rapid decline in death rates during the last 50 years due to better healthcare and nutrition, which have made this factor also important for growth of population"
8357,"the trend of population growth due to birth rate and death rate high birth rates and declining death rates were the phenomena till 1980, which resulted date of birth population growth"
8358,"after that due to government efforts and increased awareness, the birth fate also started to decline, resulting in gradual decline in the population growth rate"
8359,migration it is the movement of people across regions and territories
8360,the movement of people within the country (from one place to another) is called internal migration
8361,it does not change the population size but it changes the population distribution of an area
8362,the movement of people from one country to other is called international migration
8363,it changes population size of the country as well as population distribution
8364,"migration pattern in india in india, most of the recent migrations have been from rural areas to urban areas"
8365,"this is due to poverty and unemployment in rural areas (push factors) and increased employment opportunity and better living, conditions in urban places (pull factors)"
8366,the urban population has increased from 17.29% of the total population in 1951 to 31.8% in 2011
8367,"there has been a significant increase in the number of million plus cities from 35 to 53 in just a decade, i.e"
8368,characteristics or qualities of the population age composition the number of people in different age groups in a country is called its age composition
8369,it is one of the most basic characteristics of a population
8370,"the age of a person influences his needs, purchases, his capacity to perform"
8371,"generally, in india, people are classified into the following three age groups"
8372,"these are as follow (i) children (generally below 15 years) they are economically unproductive and need to be provided with food, clothing, education and medical care"
8373,(ii) working age (15-59 years) they are economically and biologically reproductive
8374,"in 2001, this group comprised 58.7% of the population, while children made up 34.4 % and the aged only 6.9%"
8375,(iii) aged (above 59 years) they can be economically productive though they may have retired
8376,they may be working voluntarily but they are not available for employment through recruitment
8377,dependent population the population of children and aged people together constitute the dependent population
8378,sex ratio the sex ratio is the number of females per 1000 males in the population
8379,it is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females in a society at a given time
8380,"in india, the sex ratio has always been unfavourable to females due to reasons of tradition and unscrupulous actions of people"
8381,"certain states which are progressive like kerala, have a very favourable sex ratio"
8382,"as per census 2011, the sex ratio of kerala is 1084 compared to 940 for all of india"
8383,"puducherry has 1038 females for every 1000 males, while delhi has only 866 females p*r thousand males and haryana has just 877 females per thousand"
8384,literacy rate a person who can read and write any language with understanding by the age of 7 years is considered literate
8385,the total percentage of the population of an area at a particular time aged seven years or above who can read and write with understanding is called literacy rate
8386,"although there has been a regular increase in literacy rates in the country, rural literacy lags behind urban literacy significantly and female literacy lags behind male literacy by a huge margin"
8387,according to census 2011 literacy rate in the country is 74.04%
8388,"it has revealed that urban literacy rate was 84.98 %, while that in the rural areas was only 68.91 %"
8389,"similarly, female literacy was only 65.46 %, while that for males was 82.14 %"
8390,occupational structure occupational structure referred to as the distribution’^ population according to various types of occupation
8391,"the occupations are usually categorised into primary, secondary and tertiary occupations"
8392,primary occupations are those in which natural resources are extracted from the earth
8393,secondary occupations are those in which the extracted natural resources are processed into products for use
8394,tertiary occupations are those which support the primary and secondary occupations by providing services
8395,the pattern of the working population the proportion of people working in different activities vary in developed and developing countries
8396,"the developing countries have more of their population working in primary occupations, whereas the developed nations have more of their population working in secondary and tertiary occupations"
8397,"in india, half of the population is engaged in agriculture alone"
8398,"however, due to industrialisation and urbanisation in recent times, there has occurred a significant shift towards secondary and tertiary occupations which earlier stood about 13% and 20%, respectively"
8399,"due to the sustained efforts of government, healthcare programmes, life expectancy at birth has improved from 36.7 years in 1951 to 64.7 years in 2011"
8400,the death rate has declined from 25 per 1000 persons in 1951 to 7.2 in 2011
8401,availability of safe drinking -water and proper sanitation are major problems in rural areas and need urgent action
8402,the level of nutrition and per capital calorie consumption is much below the recommended level
8403,adolescent population adolescents are population aged from 10 to 19 years
8404,they currently comprise about 20% of india’s population and are an important future resource for the country
8405,"their nutritional requirements are more than that of either adults or younger children, but it our country the diet available for them is usually inadequate for their requirements, which leads to deficiency and stunted growth"
8406,many adolescent girls suffer from anaemia and they must be made aware of their requirements through better education and literacy they confront
8407,"national population policy after recognising that the family planning would improve individual health and welfare, the government of india initiated its first family planning programme in 1952"
8408,"in the year 2000, the government formulated the national population policy (npp 2000), which had the following major objectives providing a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory school education up to 14 years of age"
8409,reducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births
8410,npp 2000 and adolescents national population policy (npp) 2000 identified adolescents as one of the major sections of the population that need greater attention
8411,"npp 2000 put greater emphasis on the important needs of adolescents including protection from unwanted pregnancies,’ sexually transmitted diseases (stds) and risks of unprotected sex"
8412,"it focussed on programmes that aim towards encouraging delayed marriage and childbearing, education of adolescents, providing food supplements and nutritional services, etc"
8413,summary human beings are important resources who not only utilise resources and but also create social and cultural environment
8414,"‘resources’, ‘calamities’ and disasters’ becomes meaningful when taken in relation to a human being"
8415,"the number, distribution, growth and characteristics of human beings provide basic background for understanding and appreciating various aspects of the environment"
8416,the census is official information about the population of a country done at regular interval (mostly 10 year period)
8417,"india has huge population of over a billion, and the population is distributed unevenly throughout the country"
8418,"the uneven distribution of population can be known by calculating population density of an area, which is the number of people per unit area"
8419,"more than half of india’s population resides in five states of uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, west bengal and andhra pradesh"
8420,"india has the third highest population density in the world, which is just after bangladesh and japan"
8421,rugged terrain and unfavourable4climatic condition are reason for sparse population in some regions such as arunachal pradesh
8422,the high population density in india is found in the northern plain and kerala
8423,the flat plain area with fertile soils and abundant rainfall are major factors contributing to high population density
8424,the change in the number of inhabitants of a country at a particular period of time is called growth of population
8425,"growth of the population is affected by births, deaths, and migration"
8426,the increase in the population calculated by subtracting the earlier population from the later is known as absolute increase in population
8427,the rate of increase of population per year is measured in terms of per cent per annum and known as the annual growth rate of population
8428,"although, india’s population is steadily increasing from 1951, but since 1981, the rate of growth has started to decline gradually"
8429,the difference between birth rate and death rate gives a natural increase in population
8430,the number of live birth per thousand persons per year is termed as birth rate
8431,the number of deaths per thousand of persons per year is termed as death rate
8432,migration is the third component of population growth which represent the movement of people from one place to another
8433,when the movement of people occurs within a country it constitutes internal migration but when the movement is between the country it constitutes external or international migration
8434,most migration in india takes place from rural areas to urban areas due to push and pull factors
8435,"adverse condition, poverty, unemployment in rural areas are push factor of migration"
8436,"greater employment opportunities, better living conditioks in the cities are pull factor of migration"
8437,the age composition of population of nation is grouped into 3 categories : children (0-14 years) adult (15-59 years) and aged (60 – above)
8438,dependency ratio is the ratio of people of dependent age (below 15 and above 60 years) to people of economically active ages (15-59 years)
8439,the number of females per 1000 males in the population is called sex ratio and is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females
8440,state of kerala and union territory of puducherry has favourable sex ratio where as delhi and haryana has very adverse sex ratio
8441,a person of 7 years or above who can read and write and understand any one language is termed as literate
8442,"agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, fishing mining and quarrying are primary occupation"
8443,adolescents constitute one-fifth of the total population of india and adequate attention has to be paid on their nutrition requirements
8444,comprehensive family planning programme in india was started in 1952 and the national population policy (npp) 2000 is a part of it
8445,"npp aims to impart free and compulsory education up to 14 years, reduce the infant mortality rate, deal with adolescent-specific problems etc"

8448,location the himalayan mountains the northern plains the peninsular plateau the indian desert the coastal plains the islands
8449,"location india has all major physical features of the earth, i.e., mountains, plains, deserts, plateaus, and islands"
8450,"in india, the soil colour varies from place to place as it is formed from different types of rocks"
8451,india has varied physical features whose formation can be explained on the basis of the ‘theory of plate tectonics’
8452,"according to the theory of plate tectonics, the seven major and minor plates that form the earth’s crust keep moving, causing stress and thus leading to folding, faulting and volcanic activity"
8453,the physical features of india can be grouped under the following physiographic divisions: the himalayan mountains or the northern mountains the northern plains or the indo-gangetic plains the peninsular plateau the great indian desert the coastal plains the islands the himalayan mountains the himalayas are young-fold mountains which are the loftiest and one of the most rugged mountain barriers of the world
8454,"the himalayas are 2400 km long, 400 km to 150 km wide from kashmir to arunachal pradesh respectively"
8455,the himalayas have three parallel ranges in the longitudinal extent namely : great or inner himalayas also called himadri
8456,the himalayas can be divided into four sections : punjab himalayas – between indus and satluj
8457,assam himalayas (eastern himalayas) – between tista and the dibang (tsangpo)
8458,the northern plains the northern plains spread over an area of 7 lakh sq
8459,"km, 240 km long and 240 km to 320 km broad"
8460,the rivers that flow to the plains from the mountains are involved in depositional work
8461,the difference in relief causes the northern plains to have four regions
8462,"bhabar – adjacent to the foothills of shiwaliks, a narrow 8 to 16 km wide belt of pebbles and boulders"
8463,bangar – older alluvial plain which rises above the level of the flood plains
8464,khadar – newer and younger alluvial of the flood plains deposited by the rivers flowing down the plain
8465,"tarai – lies adjacent to bhabar region, composed of newer alluvium and is thickly forested"
8466,the peninsular plateau the peninsular plateau is the tableland formed due to the breaking and drifting of the gondwanaland
8467,"the plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the central highlands and the deccan plateau"
8468,the eastward extensions of peninsular plateau are locally known as bundelkhand and baghelkhand
8469,the chhota nagpur plateau marks the further eastward extension drained by the damodar river
8470,"the deccan plateau, a triangular mass, lies to the south of the river narmada"
8471,the western and eastern edges of the deccan plateau are marked by the western ghats and the eastern ghats respectively
8472,"the malwa plateau is spread across rajasthan, madhya pradesh and gujarat and slopes towards the north"
8473,a distinct feature of the peninsular plateau is the black soil area known as deccan trap
8474,the indian desert the undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes towards the western margins of the aravalli hills is the indian desert
8475,crescent-shaped dunes called barchans cover large parts of the indian desert
8476,luni is the only large river that flouts in this region
8477,the coastal plains the narrow’ coastal strips flank the peninsular plateau
8478,"on the west, the coastal strips are divided into konkan (mumbai-goa), kannada plain and the malabar coast from northern to the southern part"
8479,on the east the coastal strip is divided into northern circar and the coromandel coast from northern to southern part
8480,the islands the lakshadweep islands group in the arabian sea is close to kerala
8481,we hope the given physical features of india class 9 notes social science geography chapter 2 sst pdf free download will help you
8482,"if you have any query regarding physical features of india class 9 geography chapter 2 notes, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
8483,temperature humidity air pressure cloudiness or sunshine precipitation (rainfall or snowfall) wind the weather conditions fluctuate very often within a day
8484,"based on the generalised fhonthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer and rainy seasons"
8485,"in asia, india and other south and south-eastern countries have monsoon type of climate"
8486,the word monsoon is derived from the arabic word ‘mausim’ which literally means season
8487,‘monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year
8488,"regional climatic variation in india although there is an overall unity in the general climatic pattern in india, there are some perceptible regional variations"
8489,"temperature the temperature in the winter in north-western mountainous regions can go down to – 45° c (at drass in jammu and kashmir), while it is 22°c in thiruvananthapuram in kerala"
8490,"similarly, it can go up to 50°c in summer in some parts of western rajasthan and 20°c in shillong"
8491,"in many areas, there is a wide variation between day and night temperatures"
8492,"in the thar desert, the day temperature may rise up to 50°c and drop down to near 15°c the same night"
8493,"on the other hand, there is hardly any difference in day and night temperatures in the andaman and nicobar islands or in kerala"
8494,precipitation there is a wide variation observed in its amount and seasonal distribution
8495,"precipitation in the form of snowfall occurs only in upper parts of himalayas, the rest of the country receives rainfall"
8496,"a typical example, the annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in meghalaya to less than 10 cm in ladakh and western rajasthan"
8497,"similarly, most parts of the country receive rainfall from june to september, but the tamil nadu coast gets most of its rain during october and november"
8498,"such differences help to create a variety in lives of people— the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the kind of houses they used for living and so on"
8499,climatic controls permanent factors which govern the general nature of the climate of any location on the earth are called factors of climatic controls
8500,the factors of climatic controls are m latitude the angular distance of a location from the equator in north-south direction is called latitude
8501,"due to the curvature of the earth, latitude changes the amount of solar energy received"
8502,"as a result, air temperature decreases from the equator towards the poles"
8503,"with increase of height from the earth surface, the temperature decreases and air becomes less dense"
8504,pressure and wind system it depends on the latitude and altitude of a place
8505,"thus, it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern of the area"
8506,continentality or distance from the sea the sea exerts a moderating influence on the climate
8507,"as the distance from the sea increases, the weather conditions become more extreme (high temperature and rainfall variation between seasons)"
8508,"ocean currents along with onshore winds, the ocean currents (warm or cold) affect the climate of coastal areas"
8509,relief features high mountains stop cold or hot winds from reaching a location..it can also cause rain or snow if the place is on the windward side of the mountains
8510,factors affecting india’s climatic latitude the tropic of cancer (23°3 cv n) divides the country into the tropical zone (south of this line) and the sub-tropical zone (north of this line)
8511,the line runs from the.rann of kuchchh (west) to mizoram (east)
8512,"so, india’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as sub-tropical climates"
8513,"altitude mountains- in the north of india have an average elevation of about 6000 m, whereas on the coastal areas as well as islands, maximum elevation is about 30 m"
8514,the indian sub-continent experiences milder winters as compared to central asia because of the himalayas which prevent the cold winds from entering the sub-continent
8515,pressure and winds the following atmospheric conditions govern the climate and associated weather conditions in india pressure and surface winds upper air circulation western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones pressure and surface winds india lies in the region of north-easterly surface winds
8516,these winds originate during winter from the sub-tropical high-pressure belt of the northern hemisphere
8517,"these winds blow south, get deflected to the right due to the coriolis force and move towards the equatorial-low pressure region"
8518,"these winds originate and blow over land and hence, carry very little moisture"
8519,the unique feature of indian pressure and wind conditions is its complete reversal
8520,"during winter, high-pressure areas develop over the areas north of himalayas"
8521,this causes cold dry winds blow from the area towards low-pressure area over the oceans to the south
8522,"in summer, due to high temperature, low-pressure area develops over interior asia and over north-western india"
8523,air from high-pressure areas blow towards this region resulting in complete reversal of wind direction
8524,as these winds from high pressure area of southern indian ocean crosses the equator and turns right towards low pressure areas of indian sub-continent
8525,these winds gather large moisture while moving over the warm ocean and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of india
8526,upper air circulation and western cyclonic disturbances the upper air circulation of the region (indian subcontinent) is dominated by a westerly flow which is governed by jet stream
8527,"due to their location over 27°-30° n latitude, these jet streams are known as sub-tropical westerly jet streams"
8528,"they blow south of the himalayas, throughout the year except in summer"
8529,western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones the western cyclonic disturbances are weather phenomena of the winter months brought in by the westerly flow from the mediterranean region
8530,they usually influence the weather of the north and north-western regions of india
8531,tropical cyclones occur during the monsoon as well as in october-november and are part of the easterly flow
8532,the westerly flow brings the western cyclonic disturbances in the north and north-western india
8533,"in summer, the sub-tropical westerly jet stream moves north of the himalayas due to apparent shifting of the sun"
8534,"an easterly jet stream, called sub-tropical easterly jet stream, blows over peninsular india approximately over 14° n during the summer months"
8535,"coriolis force an apparent force that as a result of the earth’s rotation, deflects moving objects like air currents to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere"
8536,"this law states that a wind in any direction tends to deflect towards right (west to east) in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere with a force that is directly proportional to the mass of the wind in question, its velocity, the sine of the latitude and the angular velocity of the earth’s rotation"
8537,"jet stream these are a narrow belt of high altitude (above 12,000 m) westerly winds’in the troposphere"
8538,their speed varies from about 110 km/h in summer to about 184 km/h in winter
8539,the most constant are the mid-latitude and the subtropical jet stream
8540,the monsoons are experienced in the tropical area roughly between 20° n and 20° s
8541,mechanism of monsoon the following facts are important to understand the mechanism of the monsoons the differential heating and cooling of land and water creates low pressure on the landmass of india while the seas around experience comparatively high pressure- the inter-tropical convergence zone (itcz) in summer season shifts its position over the ganga plain
8542,this is the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°n of the equator
8543,it is also known as the ‘monsoon trough’ during the monsoon season
8544,"the presence of the high-pressure area, east of madagascar (approximately 20°s over the indian ocean)"
8545,the intensity and position of this high-pressure area affect the indian monsoon
8546,"the tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer, which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over the plateau at about 9 km above sea level"
8547,the movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the indian peninsula during summer
8548,"apart from the given facts, it has been noticed that changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons"
8549,"normally, when the tropical eastern south pacific ocean experiences high pressure, the tropical eastern indian ocean experiences low pressure"
8550,"but in past a few years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions and the eastern pacific has lower pressure in comparison to the eastern indian ocean"
8551,this periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the southern oscillation (so)
8552,"el nino southern oscillations (enso) the difference in pressure over tahiti (pacific ocean, 18°s/149°w) and darwin in northern australia (indian ocean, 12°30’s/131°e) is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons"
8553,"if the pressure differences were negative, it would mean below average and late monsoons"
8554,the el nino phenomenon is a feature connected with the southern oscillation
8555,"in this, a warm ocean current flows past the peruvian coast, in place of the cold peruvian current"
8556,the changes in pressure conditions are connected to the el nino
8557,"hence, the phenomenon is referred to as enso (el nino southern oscillations)"
8558,the onset and withdrawal of the monsoon the trade winds are steady but the monsoon winds are pulsating in nature
8559,"they are affected by different atmospheric conditions encountered by it, on its way over the warm tropical area"
8560,"starting from early june in the southern part of the indian peninsula, the monsoon lasts between 100 and 120 days, withdrawing by mid-september"
8561,rainfall increases suddenly and continues for several days at the time of arrival of monsoon
8562,onset of monsoon monsoon generally reaches the southern tip of the peninsula during the first week of june
8563,"after striking the southern tip, it branches into two parts- the arabian sea branch and the bay of bengal branch; both branches move rapidly"
8564,"the arabian sea branch advances north along the western ghats, reaching mumbai by about 10th of june and soon covers the saurashtra-kuchchh and central most part of the deccan plateau also"
8565,"the bay of bengal branch reaches assam in the first week of june and gets deflected towards the west by the mountain ranges, thus giving rainfall to the ganga plains"
8566,both the branches again merge over the north-western part of the ganga plains
8567,"delhi receives rainfall from bay of bengal branch by the end of june (tentative date is 29th june) and by the first-week of july, monsoon covers western uttar pradesh, punjab, haryana and eastern rajasthan"
8568,withdrawal of monsoon withdrawal or the retreat of the monsoon is a more gradual process
8569,"by mid-october, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula"
8570,the withdrawal from the southern half of the peninsula is fairly rapid
8571,"by early december, the » monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country"
8572,onset and withdrawal of monsoon in the indian islands the islands receive the very first monsoon showers from the last week of april to the first week of may
8573,the withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south (in reverse direction) from the first week of december to the first week of january
8574,"by this time, the rest of the country is already under the influence of the winter monsoon"
8575,important features of monsoon the important features of monsoon are as follows the monsoon is also known for its uncertainties
8576,"there is an alteration of dry and wet spells which vary in intensity, frequency and duration"
8577,"while it causes heavy floods in one part, it may be responsible for drought in other parts"
8578,"its irregular arrival and retreat (sometimes due to the effect of el nino), causing disruption .of farming schedules and causing droughts in certain areas of the country"
8579,"the seasons the distinct, seasonal pattern is an important characteristic of monsoon type of climate"
8580,the weather conditions in india greatly change from one season to another
8581,these changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country
8582,the coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern
8583,the cold weather season (winter) the cold weather season begins from mid-november and stays till february in northern parts of india with december and january as the coldest months
8584,"for instance, the average temperature of chennai, on the eastern coast, is between 24°—25°c while in northern plains, it ranges between 10°—15°c"
8585,frost occurs in the northern plains and snow falls in the high mountainous regions of himalayas
8586,"as the north-east trade winds blow during this period, most of the country remains dry as they blow from land towards sea"
8587,the only rain occurs in tamil nadu and southern andhra pradesh due to these winds picking up moisture from the bay of bengal
8588,"influenced by the relief, the light winds moving outwards from this area blow through the ganga valley from the west and the north-west"
8589,"clear sky, low temperature and humidity, and feeble, variable winds are the characteristics of the weather during the period"
8590,"there is an inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the north-west, which have originated over the mediterranean sea and western asia"
8591,they cause winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains
8592,this winter rainfall though in small amount is locally known as mahawat
8593,"the peninsular region has moderating effect from sea and hence, it doesn’t have well defined cold seasons"
8594,the hot weather season(summer) the hot weather season starts with the apparent movement of the sun towards the north
8595,the hot weather season starts in march and lasts upto the end of may
8596,features of hot weather season the characteristic features of hot weather season are the temperature of the northern part of india goes up and the atmospheric pressure comes down
8597,"towards the end of may, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region extending from thar desert in north-west to patna and chotanagpur plateau in the east and south-east"
8598,"a hot gusty and dry wind, locally known as loo, blows"
8599,during this season over the north and north-western india and can cause even death if persons are exposed to it for a long time
8600,dust storms are very common in north india in the month of may
8601,they bring temporary relief from the heat by lowering the temperature and may also cause light rain and cold breeze
8602,"localised thunderstorms also occur during summer, which may have high speed winds and even precipitate hail"
8603,"these are called mango showers in kerala and karnataka, as they help in the early ripening of the mango fruit"
8604,temperature variation during hot weather the influence of the shifting of heat belt can be seen from temperature recordings taken during march to may at different latitudes
8605,"in march, the highest temperature is about 38°c, recorded in deccan plateau"
8606,temperature in gujarat and madhya pradesh is around 42°c in the month of april
8607,"in may, north-western parts of the country experience temperature around 45°"
8608,"due to moderating influence of the oceans, temperature remains lower in peninsular india"
8609,advancing monsoon (the rainy season) the low-pressure area over the northern plains intensifies by mid-june and attracts the trade winds
8610,these trade winds originate over the warm tropical ocean in the southern hemisphere
8611,"after crossing equator, these blow in the south-west direction entering peninsula as south-west monsoon"
8612,they cover the entire subcontinent except extreme north-west in just over one month
8613,maximum rainfall due to these winds occurs in north-eastern india (mainly meghalaya and assam) and the windward side of the western ghats (thiruvananthapuram to mumbai) as these winds bring abundant moisture to the sub-continent at a velocity of 30 kmph
8614,rainfall in the western ghats and deccan plateau the monsoon winds cover the country in about a month
8615,a total change in weather is brought up in india by the inflow of the south-west monsoon in india
8616,"the windward side of the western ghats receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm in the early season"
8617,"inspite lying in the rain shadow area, the deccan plateau and parts of madhya pradesh also receive some amount of rainfall"
8618,areas of maximum and least rainfall the maximum rainfall of this season is received by the north-eastern part of the country
8619,the highest average rainfall in the world falls at mawsynram in the southern ranges of the khasi hills in meghalaya
8620,"in the northern plains precipitation decreases from east to west, with western parts of rajasthan and northern parts of gujarat getting the least rainfall"
8621,these breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of monsoon trough
8622,"the axis of the monsoon trough in the northern plains keeps moving north to south and back, causing periodic breaks in rainfall"
8623,the monsoon rains take place only for a few days at a time
8624,monsoon trough the trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall
8625,"when the axis of the trough lies over the plains, the region gets good rainfall"
8626,"with the northward movement of axis, the himalayan region gets widespread rain which is the catchment area of various rivers"
8627,this causes devastating floods in the plains causing heavy damage to life and property
8628,"tropical depression another phenomenon, which determines amount and suration of the monsoon, is the frequency and intensity of tropical depression which form at the head of the bay of bengal and cross over to mainland"
8629,these depressions follow the axis of the ‘monsoon trough of low pressure’
8630,retreating/post monsoon season (the transition season) the sun starts shifting towards the south during october-november
8631,"during this time, the low pressure trough over the northern plains weakens and is replaced gradually by a high-pressure system"
8632,"by the beginning of october, the monsoon withdraws from the northern plains"
8633,the months of october-november form a transition period from hot rainy to dry winter conditions
8634,the day temperatures are high but nights are cool and pleasant
8635,"due to the temperature still remaining high and humidity not reducing, the heat is oppressive"
8636,"cyclonic depression and tropical cyclone by early november, cyclonic depressions originate over the andaman sea"
8637,it causes tropical cyclones on the coastline from bangladesh to tamil nadu as low-pressure conditions get transferred to the bay of bengal
8638,these cyclones generally cross the eastern coast of india causing heavy and widespread rain
8639,"sometimes, these cyclones arrive at the coasts of odisha, west bengal and bangladesh"
8640,"these cyclones frequently strike the populated deltas of the godavari, krishna and kaveri"
8641,the coromandel coast gets its monsoon rainfall mostly during october and november from the cyclones and due to the retreating monsoon picking up moisture over the bay of bengal
8642,"distribution of rainfall annually, parts of western coast and north-eastern india receive over about 400 cm of rainfall"
8643,"however, it is less than 60 cm in western rajasthan and adjoining parts of gujarat, haryana and punjab"
8644,rainfall is equally low in the interior of the deccan plateau and east of the sahyadris
8645,a third area of low precipitation is around leh in jammu and kashmir
8646,"owing to the nature of monsoons, the annual rainfall is highly variable from year to year"
8647,"variability is high in the regions of low rainfall such as parts of rajasthan, gujarat and the leeward side of the western ghats"
8648,"due to this, the areas of high rainfall are liable to be affected by floods whereas, areas of low rainfall are drought-prone"
8649,monsoon as a unifying bond northern india has comparatively higher temperatures than other areas of the world at a similar latitude due to the himalayas protecting it from the cold central asian winds
8650,the peninsular plateau has moderate temperatures due to the influence of the sea on three sides
8651,"however, the monsoon unites the land like no other force, because it provides a rhythmic cycle of seasons"
8652,"the vegetation, animal life and agricultural activities are all revolving around the effects of the monsoon"
8653,"the life of the people, their celebration of festivals and other activities all are geared to the monsoon as india is still primarily an agricultural nation"
8654,"the monsoon provides the water to set agricultural activities in motion and hence, the arrival of the monsoon is awaited eagerly"
8655,the river valleys which carry this water also unite as single river valley unit
8656,"summary climate is the sum total of the weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time, generally more than 30 years"
8657,weather is the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time
8658,"various elements of weather and climate are temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation"
8659,india along with south and south-east asia has monsoon type of climate
8660,"the climate of any place is controlled by latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea, ocean currents and relief features"
8661,high mountain by blocking the rain-bearing winds helps in causing rainfall in windward side of mountain
8662,"the atmospheric conditions which govern the climate and weather condition of india are-pressure and surface winds, upper air circulation, western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclone"
8663,coriolis force which is generated by the rotation of the earth is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in northern hemisphere and towards the left in southern hemisphere
8664,"south-west monsoon winds are south-east trade winds of southern hemisphere which after crossing equator, become south-western trade winds (due to rightward deflection by coriolis force)"
8665,"as they blow over warm ocean, they cause rainfall in indian sub-continent"
8666,jet streams are fast blowing winds moving in the upper atmosphere
8667,shallow cyclonic depressions originating over the mediterranean sea are known as western disturbances
8668,it refers to the reasonal reversal in wind direction throughout the year
8669,the inter tropical convergence zone (itcz) is a broad trough of low pressure in equatorial latitude
8670,"in itcz, there is convergence of north-east and south-east trade wind"
8671,southern oscillation (so) is the reversal of pressure conditions and vice-versa in southern pacific ocean and eastern indian ocean
8672,"the changes in pressure conditions are connected to el nino, hence, the phenomenon is referred to as enso"
8673,monsoons are pubating in nature and are affected by different atmospheric conditions
8674,"the arabian sea branch of monsoon causes rainfall in western ghat, mumbai, gujarat and central india"
8675,the bay of bengal branch of monsoon causes rainfall in north-east india and ganga plain
8676,the sudden and continuous rain associated with violent thunder and lightning is called burst of monsoon
8677,arabian sea branch and bay of bengal branch are the two branches of south-west monsoon in india
8678,el nino is a warm ocean current that flows past the peruvian coast in place of cold peruvian current every 2 to 5 years
8679,"’ cold weather, hot weather, advancing monsoon and retreating monsoon are four-main seasons in india"
8680,"the cold weather season is associated with clear sky, low temperature, low humidity and feeble, variable wind"
8681,"due to the moderating influence of sea, the peninsular region does not have a well defined cold season"
8682,loo is hot and dry winds blowing during the day over the north and north-western india in the summer season
8683,"this localised thunderstorm of the summer season is associated with violent winds, torrential downpours and is often accompanied by hail"
8684,it is located in southern range of khasi hills in meghalaya
8685,"the rainless intervals interspersing the monsoon rain is called ‘breaks in monsoon.’ the monsoon trough is the intense and elongated low-pressure area, which develops over north-western india"
8686,it extends from the thar desert in west to chota nagpur plateau in east
8687,the pre-monsoon shower in coastal karnataka and kerala is called mango shower
8688,the hot and humid condition which makes the weather oppressive is called october heat
8689,it occurs towards the end of retreating monsoon in the month of october
8690,"with a rhythmic cycle of seasons, in which people celebrate many festivals and do other activities, the monsoon unites the indian sub-continent and acts as a unifying bond"
8691,we hope the given climate class 9 notes social science geography chapter 4 sst pdf free download will help you
8692,"if you have any query regarding climate class 9 geography chapter 4 notes, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
8693,"endemic species those plant species which originated from the country, are termed as endemic species"
8694,exotic species those plant species which originated outside the country are termed as exotic species
8695,"factors affecting diversity factors which influence the variety of flora and fauna include relief (land and soil), climate (temperature, photoperiod and precipitation) and the ecosystem"
8696,"whether it is plain, hilly or a plateau, determines the kind of vegetation which will grow in it"
8697,undulating (wavy) and rough surfaces generally develop either into grasslands or woodlands (forests)
8698,different types of land accordingly sustain and provide shelter to different kinds of wildlife
8699,"for example, alluvial or deltaic soil of a river delta near the sea will sustain mangrove forests while slopes of hills have conical trees"
8700,"for example, migratory birds like the siberian cranes and flamingoes are found to nest in the wetlands of the rann of kuchchh, where the desert merges with the sea"
8701,temperature the temperature along with the humidity in the air and precipitation determine the character of vegetation and its extent
8702,"as the climate gets colder, either by increase in altitude (above 915m) or by going away from the equator, the vegetation will change from tropical to sub-tropical, temperate and then alpine"
8703,"for example, on the slopes of the himalayas and hills of the peninsula, the fall in temperature affects the type of vegetation and its growth"
8704,photoperiod (sunlight) the amount and duration of sunlight is known as photoperiod
8705,"the difference in latitude, altitude and season brings variation in duration of sunlight in different places"
8706,"in warmer regions and climates, plant growth is faster due to longer duration of sunlight, especially with availability of adequate moisture"
8707,an instance is the fact that the southern slopes of the himalayas are covered with thicker vegetation than the northern slopes
8708,precipitation advancing south-west monsoon (june to september) and retreating north-east (october- november) monsoons bring almost all the rainfall in india
8709,areas of heavy rainfall always have denser vegetation than other areas with lesser rainfall
8710,"the south-west monsoon rains on the windward side of the western ghats, thus cause a heavy growth of tropical evergreen forests there, whereas the leeward side does not have any such forests"
8711,ecosystem various species of plants occur in areas having similar climatic conditions
8712,to a large extent its nature determines the animal life in that area
8713,all the plants and animals in an area are interdependent on each other in their physical environment and form an ecosystem
8714,"thus, an ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the non-living, physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight"
8715,biome it is a major community of plants and animals having similar life forms existing under similar environmental conditions
8716,a biome is identified on the basis of plant existing there
8717,human influence in an ecosystem human beings influence ecosystem in the following manner they utilise the vegetation and wildlife
8718,the greed of human beings leads to over utilisation of natural resources
8719,human beings cut the trees and kill the animals creating ecological imbalance
8720,"due to the activities of human beings, some of the ‘ plants and animals have reached the verge of extinction"
8721,"they influence climate, reduce soil erosion, regulate stream flow, provide raw material for industries and livelihood for many, etc"
8722,"change in nature of vegetation in india factors like growing demand for cultivated land, development of industries and mining, urbanisation have changed natural vegetation"
8723,"the vegetation cover of india in large parts is no more natural in the real sense, except in some inaccessible regions like the himalayas, the hilly region of central india and the marusthali"
8724,"in most of the places, it is either modified, replaced or degraded by human interference"
8725,types of vegetation relief and climatic factors develop different types of vegetation
8726,"based on the major forest types, india has following types of vegetation"
8727,"tropical evergreen forests tropical deciduous forests tropical thorn forests and scrubs montane forests mangrove forests note: according to india state of forest report (sfr) 2015, the forest cover in india is 21.34% which was 21.05% in the year 2011"
8728,they cover about 12% of the total forested areas of india
8729,they are found in areas where the annual rainfall is over 200 cm
8730,"regions of occurrence western slopes of the western ghats, both groups of islands (lakshadweep, andaman and nicobar islands), upper parts of assam and some parts of the coasts of tamil nadu and odisha"
8731,"characteristics of tropical evergreen forest as these areas are warm and wet almost throughout the year, they have abundant vegetation with tall trees (up to 60 m), creepers and bushes"
8732,"these appear green throughout the year, as the trees shed their leaves at different times"
8733,"flora and fauna ebony, mahogany, cinchona, rubber and rosewood trees are useful commercial trees found here"
8734,"animals found here include rhinoceros, elephants, various species of monkey, lemur, deer, many bird varieties, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails"
8735,tropical deciduous forests these cover about 64% of the fetal forested areas of the country and are the most abundant variety of forests in india
8736,these are also called monsoon forests and also spread over the region receiving rainfall between 200 to 70 cm
8737,trees of this forest type shed their leaves for about 6 to 8 weeks in dry summer
8738,"types of tropical deciduous forest on the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous"
8739,moist deciduous forests growing in annual rainfall areas between 100 and 200 cm are classified as moist deciduous
8740,"they are found mostly in the eastern part of the country such as north-eastern states, west odisha, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, foothills of the himalayas and the leeward side of the western ghats"
8741,"teak (dominant species), bamboo, sal, shisham, sandalwood, khair, kusum, arjun and mulberry trees are found in these forests"
8742,dry deciduous forests growing in annual rainfall areas between 70 and ‘100 cm are classified as dry deciduous
8743,these are found in rainier parts of the peninsular plateau and the plains of uttar pradesh and bihar
8744,many parts of these areas have been cleared for agricultural activities and for grazing
8745,"besides lions, tigers, elephants, pigs and deer many varieties of birds, lizards, snakes and tortoises are found in these forests"
8746,tropical thorn forests and scrubs these cover about 5% of the total forested areas of india
8747,these are found in areas where the annual rainfall is less than 70 cm
8748,"region of occurrence these are found in north-western part of the country including semi-arid areas of gujarat, rajasthan, some areas of uttar pradesh, chattisgarh, haryana and madhya pradesh, as well as parts of the deccan plateau"
8749,characteristics of tropical thorn forests and scrubs the trees found in tropical thorn forest and scrubs are scattered
8750,"other such plants which have long roots, succulent stems and small thick leaves are also found here"

8756,natural vegetation changes with corresponding change in temperature with increasing altitude in the mountainous region
8757,these succession of natural vegetation belts is same as in the order from tropical to tundra vegetation
8758,"altitudinal distribution of montane forests wet temperate forest at lower altitude between 1,000-2,000 m, wet temperate forests with evergreen broad leaf trees such as oaks and chestnuts are prominent"
8759,"temperate forest at the altitude between 1,500-3,000 m, temperate forests containing coniferous trees like pine, deodar, silver fir, spruce and cedar are found"
8760,"these forests cover mostly the southern slopes of the himalayas, places having high altitude in southern and north-east india"
8761,"at high altitude above 3,600 m, temprate forest and grasslands give way to the alpine vegetation"
8762,alpine vegetation this vegetation through shrubs and scrubs merge into alpine grasslands

9370,"social exclusion a social exclusion means living in a poor surrounding with poor people, excluded from enjoying social equality of better off people in the better surrounding"
9371,"social exclusion can be a cause as well as a result of poverty which leads to exclusion of individuals or groups from facilities, benefits and opportunities that others enjoy"

9373,"vulnerability vulnerability to poverty is a measure, which describes the greater probability of certain communities e.g"
9374,"widow, physically handicapped person of becoming or remaining poor in the coming time"
9375,"vulnerability is determined by various options available to different communities in terms of assets, education, job, health, etc and analyse their ability to face various risks like natural disasters"
9376,the group which face greater risk at the time of natural calamity are called vulnerable groups
9377,poverty line poverty line is an imaginary line used by any country to determine its poverty
9378,it is considered appropriate by a country according to its existing social norms
9379,"it varies from time to time, place to place and country to country"
9380,the most common method of determining poverty is income or consumption levels i.e
9381,people will be considered poor if their income or consumption level falls below a given ‘minimum level’ (poverty line) necessary to fulfil the basic needs
9382,"poverty line estimation in india in india, a subsistence level or minimum level of food requirement (as determined by its calorific value), clothing, footwear, fuel, lighting,-educational and medical requirements, etc are determined for estimating the poverty line"
9383,"since ih rural and urban areas, the nature of work and the prices of goods are different, the calorific requirement and expenditure per capita are also different"
9384,poverty line defined by the government as follows the money value required for buying these calorie requirements (given in the last column) in terms of foodgrains and other items is revised periodically based on rise in prices of these goods
9385,"in urban areas, the prices of essential items is higher when compared to the rural areas and so, the poverty line is higher despite having low calorific requirement per day"
9386,organisations involved in estimating poverty line surveys for determining poverty line are carried out by the national sample survey organisation (nsso)
9387,it is an organisation under the ministry of statistics and programme implementation of the government of india
9388,it is the largest organisation in india conducting regular socio-economic surveys
9389,"for determining the poverty line in various countries and for their comparison, international organisations like the world bank use a uniform standard method"

9393,group vulnerable to poverty poverty among social groups and economic categories varies widely in india
9394,social vulnerable groups are the households of the scheduled castes (scs) and scheduled tribes (sts)
9395,economically vulnerable groups comprise rural landless labour households and urban casual labour households

9408,"in states like kerala, jammu and kashmir, andhra pradesh, tamil nadu, gujarat, west bengal, there is a significant decline in poverty"
9409,the states successful in reducing poverty have adopted different methods for doing so
9410,some examples are punjab and haryana had high agricultural growth rates due to the effects of the green revolution
9411,kerala has developed its human resources by investing more in education
9412,public distribution of foodgrains at subsidised prices in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu has helped in poverty reduction
9413,jammu and kashmir have generated wide-ranging economic activities all across the state and converted potential in various sectors into employment opportunities
9414,"global poverty scenario although extreme economic poverty has reduced in the world from 43% in 1990 to 22% in 2008 (as per the world bank), still there are vast regional differences"
9415,these are stated below the proportion of people living under poverty in different countries is defined by the international poverty line (means population below $1 a day)

9437,economic growth widens opportunities and provides the resources needed to invest in human development
9438,high economic growth encourages people to send their children (including the girl child) to school with hope of better economic returns from investing in education
9439,"due to lack of growth in the agricultural sector, the large number of people remain poor in rural areas"
9440,(ii) targeted anti-poverty programmes the government introduced targeted anti-poverty programmes starting from 1990
9441,the results of these programmes have been mixed due to lack of proper implementation and improper targeting
9442,"thus, the benefits of these schemes are not fully reaching the deserving poor"
9443,"so, now the government is emphasising more on proper monitoring of all these programmes"
9444,"millennium development goals these are eight international development goals that were officially established following the millennium summit of the united nations in 2000, following the adoption of the united nations millennium declaration"
9445,one of these was to reduce by 50% the proportion of people living on less than us $1 a day by the year 2015
9446,"the challenges to poverty reduction poverty reduction is still a major challenge in india, due to the wide differences between regions as well as rural and urban areas"
9447,"further, poverty should include not only the matter of the adequate amount of food but other factors like education, healthcare, shelter, job security, gender, equality, dignity and so on"
9448,poverty reduction is expected to be lower in the next 10-15 years
9449,"in addition to anti-poverty measures, the government should focus on the following to reduce poverty"

9490,"human capital formation: when the existing human resource is further developed by spending on making the workforce more educated and healthy, it is called human capital formation"
9491,"quality of population: the quality of population depends upon the literacy rate, life expectancy and skills formation acquired by the people of the country"
9492,role of education: education is the most important component of human resource development
9493,"in view of its contribution towards the growth of the society, government expenditure on education as a percentage of gdp rose from 0.64% in 1951-52 to 3.98% in 2002-03"
9494,"however, our national goal is 6% of gdp health: health is another very important component of human resource development"
9495,there has been a considerable improvement in the country’s health standard

9517,"but persons above the poverty line might also be food insecure when the country faces a national disaster/calamity like earthquake, drought, flood, tsunami, widespread failure of crops causing famine, etc.- the total production of foodgrains decreases due to a natural calamity"
9518,the price of the food products goes up due to this shortage
9519,"if such calamity happens in a very wide area or is stretched over a longer time period, it may cause a situation of starvation"
9520,famine and starvation a famine is characterised by widespread deaths due to starvation and epidemics caused by forced use of impure water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation
9521,the most devastating famine in india was the famine of bengal in 1943

9533,"to create food security, current hunger should be removed and the risk of future hunger should be reduced"
9534,"national health and family survey (nhfs) 1998-95 a large-scale, multi-round survey conducted in a representative sample of households throughout india"
9535,three rounds of the survey have been conducted since the first survey in 1992-93 and this was the second
9536,the survey provided .essential data on health and family welfare needed by the ministry of health and family welfare and other agencies for policy and programme purposes as well as information on important emerging health and family welfare issues
9537,these are as follows (i) chronic hunger it is a consequence of a diet regularly deficient in quantity and quality this is caused due to lack of income to buy food for survival

9547,"the highest rate of growth was achieved in punjab and uttar pradesh, where foodgrain production jumped from 7.23 million tonnes in 1964-65 to reach an all-time high of 78.9 million tonnes in 2012-13"
9548,"production of foodgrains in uttarakhand, jharkhand, assam, tamil nadu has dropped"

9550,"indira gandhi, the then prime minister of india, officially recorded the impressive progress of the green revolution in agriculture by releasing a special stamp entitled ‘wheat revolution’ in julyl968"
9551,"food corporation of india (fci) this was set-up under the food corporation’s act 1964, in order to support operations for safeguarding the farmers, distribution of foodgrains throughout the country tor pds and maintaining satisfactory level of operational and buffer stocks"
9552,minimum support price (msp) this is the price at which the government (through the food corporation of india) purchases crops from the farmers
9553,"presently, there are 27 crops being purchased with such prices including varieties of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fibre crops and others"
9554,food security in india the green revolution was started in early 70s
9555,"since then, our country has avoided famine even during adverse weather conditions"
9556,india has become self-sufficient in foodgrains during the last 30 years due to the variety of crops grown
9557,"foodgrains availability even in adverse conditions has been ensured by the government through a food security system consisting of maintaining a buffer stock of foodgrains, alongwith a public distribution system (pds) for foodgrains and other essential items"
9558,buffer stock it is the stock of foodgrains (wheat and rice) procured by the government
9559,government purchases wheat and rice from farmers through the food corporation of india (fci) states having surplus production
9560,the farmers are paid a minimum support price (msp) for their crops
9561,the msp is announced at the beginning of the sowing season to give an incentive to the farmers to grow more
9562,these purchased foodgrains are stored in granaries as a buffer stock
9563,this stock is maintained to distribute foodgrains through the pds in the areas of the country where production is less
9564,"it is provided, to the poorer sections of society at subsidised prices, i.e"
9565,lower than the market price which is known as the issue price
9566,the buffer stock also helps to resolve the problem of food shortage due to a calamity or in adverse weather conditions
9567,"programmes for food security in india in mid-1970s, national sample survey organisation (nsso) reported the high incidence of poverty level"
9568,they are public distribution system (pds) for foodgrains integrated child development services (icds) food-for work (ffw) programme

9578,rationing in india was introduced in 1940s against the backdrop of the bengal famine
9579,"later, it was revived in the wake of an acute food shortage during 1960s prior to the green revolution"
9580,"current status of public distribution system in the beginning, the pds coverage was universal with no discrimination between the poor and non-poor"
9581,"in 1992, a revamped public distribution system (rpds) was started in 1,700 blocks of the country to provide the benefits of pds in remote and backward areas"
9582,"in 1997, a targeted public distribution system (tpds) was introduced to target the ‘poor in all areas’, with a lower issue price for foodgrains for them compared to the price paid by non-poor people"
9583,"further in year 2000, two special schemes antyodaya anna yojana (aay) and annapura scheme (aps) were launched"
9584,"under the scheme, 1 crore of the poorest among the bpl families covered under the targeted public distribution system (tpds) were identified"
9585,"poor families were identified by the respective state rural development departments through a below poverty, line (bpl) survey"
9586,25 kg of foodgrains were made available to each eligible family at a highly subsidised+ rate of rs
9587,this quantity was increased from 25 kg to 35 kg from april 2002

9589,"following are some remarkable achievements of pds pds has helped government to stabilise foodgrain prices, so that it is available to consumers at affordable rates"
9590,it has helped in avoiding widespread hunger and famine by supplying food from surplus regions to deficit ones
9591,"it also helped in increasing foodgrain production, besides providing income security to farmers in some areas"
9592,"criticisms of pds the implementation of the pds still needs to be improved, because of the following reasons buffer stocks are much higher than the rules"
9593,"in some fci godowns, grains are getting damaged or eaten by rats and still instances of hunger are prevalent"
9594,high level of buffer stock of 65.3 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2014 was much more than the minimum level of buffer norms
9595,"the excess stock of foodgrains bought from farmers at high , prices leads to high carrying costs for the government, besides leading to deterioration and wastage"
9596,the pressure exerted by leading foodgrain producing states to increase the buying cost has increased msp
9597,"the rising’ msp has increased the maintenance cost of procured foodgrains, storage cost and transportation cost"
9598,"the buying of foodgrains is concentrated in a few prosperous states like punjab, haryana western uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh and to a lesser extent in west bengal"
9599,"the high msps have made farmers to cultivate wheat and rice more resulting in depletion of the water table, as they require more water to grow"
9600,"this has also led to soil degradation, endangering future sustainability of agricultural development in the regions where these are grown"
9601,malpractices in pds pds has also become ineffective in many regions of the country because dealers running the ration shops are indulged in malpractices the malpractices indulged into by the dealers include diverting the grains to open market to get a better margin
9602,"the malpractices have resulted in consumers of bihar, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh and odisha buying much less foodgrains than the national average from the ration shops"
9603,"in the southern states, where the shops are run by cooperatives, the consumers purchase much more than the national average"
9604,"since the introduction of targeted distribution system (tpds), with three levels of prices for three different income level families, the above poverty line (apl) families do not have much incentive to buy foodgrains from the ration shops"
9605,the prices for these families are not significantly lower than market prices
9606,subsidy it is a payment that a government makes to a producer to supplement the market price of a commodity
9607,subsidy helps in keeping consumer prices low while maintaining a higher income for domestic producers

9613,the programme is open to all rural poor who are in need of wage employment and desire to do manual unskilled work
9614,it is implemented as a 100% centrally sponsored scheme and the foodgrains are provided to the states free of cost
9615,"the collector is the nodal officer at the district level and has the overall responsibility of planning, implementation, coordination, monitoring and supervision"
9616,"poverty alleviation programmes (paps) over the last few years, several other poverty alleviation programmes (paps), were launched mostly in rural areas"

9625,ads organises training and capacity building programmes on food security for ngos
9626,the ads grain bank programme is acknowledged as a successful and innovative food security intervention
9627,"summary the availability, accessibility and affordability of food to all people at all times is called food security"
9628,"when there is problems in food production or distribution, poor household has to suffer the most"
9629,"the food, security in india depends on the public distribution system (pds) and vigilant and timely action of the government"
9630,food is an essential item for the survival of human being
9631,"food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food available (availability), all person having the capacity to buy food (affortat>ijit^) and there is no barrier on access to food (accessibility)"
9632,the poorest strata of society are mostly food insecure and the better off might face food insecurity during national disaster and calamity
9633,"during natural calamity there is decrease in foodgrain production, which causes shortage of foodgrain"
9634,epidemics during famine is caused by forced use of contaminated water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation
9635,"landless people, traditional artisans, petty self employed workers and destitutes including beggars are worst affected groups from food and nutrition insecurity"

9638,"economically backward states, with high incidence of poverty, tribal and rural areas, regions prone to natural disaster has largest number of food insecure people"
9639,"for example, bihar, jharkhand, eastern up, west bengal, madhya pradesh, maharashtra etc"
9640,the chronic hunger is the consequence of a diet regularly deficient in quantity and quality due to lack of income
9641,the seasonal hunger is the consequence of seasonal nature of food production and harvesting which affects landless agricultural labourers the most
9642,the food security system of government consist of component of buffer stock and public distribution system
9643,buffer stock is the stock of foodgrains (wheat and rice) procured by government (through fci) from surplus producing state for distribution (through pds) to deficit states and the poorest section of society

9655,"in an election, the voters make many choices like they can choose who will make laws for them"
9656,they can choose who will form the government and take major decisions
9657,they can choose the party whose policies will guide the government and lawmaking
9658,elections are held in all democratic countries and also in most of the non-democratic countries in many ways
9659,but there is a simple list of the minimum conditions which make an election democratic like everyone should have the right to choose a representative
9660,it means everyone has one vote and every vote has equal value
9661,political parties and candidates should be free to contest elections and offer some real choices to the voters
9662,for that elections must be held regularly after a certain period
9663,elections are conducted in a free and fair manner where people choose those representatives whom they really wish
9664,political competition takes place when different political parties compete to gain confidence and ultimately the vote of the voters
9665,this electoral competition has many demerits like it creates a sense of disunity and factionalism (groupism) and party-politics in every locality
9666,different political parties and candidates often use dirty tricks like booth capturing to win elections
9667,the pressure to win electoral fights does not allow to- form useful long term policies
9668,the competition leads to the idea of being dragged into the unhealthy competition
9669,that’s why good people do not enter and participate in political competition
9670,the electoral competition also has some merits like regular electoral competition provides incentives to political parties and leaders
9671,"if they can satisfy the voters with their work, they will be able to win again"
9672,"if a political party is motivated only by the desire to be in power, even then it will be forced to serve the people"
9673,"system of elections in india in india, lok sabha and vidhan sabha (assembly) elections are held regularly every five years"
9674,"after five years, the term of all the elected representatives comes to an end"
9675,"elections are held in all constituencies at the same time, either on the same day or within a few days"
9676,sometimes an election is held only for one constituency to fill the vacancy caused by death or resignation of a member
9677,"electoral constituencies in india, an area based system of representation is followed where the country is divided into different areas for purpose of elections"
9678,"for the lok sabha election, india is divided into 543 constituencies"
9679,the representative elected from each constituency is called member of parliament or an mp
9680,one of the features of a democratic election is that every vote has equal value
9681,"for vidhan sabha election, each state is divided into a specific number of assembly constituencies and the elected representative of eaph assembly constituency is called the member of legislative assembly or an mla"
9682,"by-election: if a representative from a constituency dies while in office or if the office-falls are vacant because of reasons like resignation, fresh elections are held in that particular constituency"
9683,constituency’ voters in a geographical area who elect a representative to the legislative bodies
9684,each village or town is divided into different wards that are like constituencies
9685,each ward elects one member of the village or the urban local body
9686,sometimes these constituencies are counted as ‘seats’ and each constituency represents one seat in the assembly
9687,"for example, when we say that ‘lok dal won 60 seats1 in haryana, it means that candidates of lok dal won in 60 assembly constituencies in the state and thus lok dal had 60 mlas in the state assembly"
9688,"reserved constituencies the constitution makers were worried that in an open electoral competition, certain weaker sections may not stand a good chance to get elected to the lok sabha and the state legislative assemblies"
9689,"if that happens, our parliament and assemblies would be deprived of the voice of a significant section of our population"
9690,reservation for sc and st the makers of our constitution thought of a special system of reserved constituencies for the weaker sections
9691,some constituencies are reserved for people who belong to the scheduled castes (sc) and scheduled tribes (st)
9692,"in an sc reserved constituency, only someone who belongs to the scheduled castes can stand for election"
9693,"similarly, only those belonging to the scheduled tribes can contest an election from a constituency reserved for st"
9694,reservation in lok sabha/ district/local level a few seats in lok sabha are reserved for scheduled castes (scs) and scheduled tribes (sts)
9695,this number is in proportion to their share in the total population
9696,"in the year 2012, 84 seats are reserved for the scheduled castes and 47 for the scheduled tribes (in lok sabha)"
9697,"thus, the reserved seats for sc and st do not take away the legitimate share of any other social group"
9698,this system of reservation was extended later to other weaker sections at the district and local level
9699,"in many states, seats in rural (panchayat) and urban (municipalities and corporations) local bodies are now reserved for other backward classes (obc) as well"
9700,"however, the proportion of seats reserved varies from state to state"
9701,"similarly, one-third of the seats are reserved in rural and urban local bodies for women candidates"
9702,"voters list when the constituencies are decided, the next step is to decide who can and who cannot vote"
9703,"in a democratic election, the list of those who are eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and given to everyone"
9704,this list is officially called the electoral roll and is commonly known as the voters’ list
9705,this is an important step as it is linked to the first condition of a democratic election i.e
9706,all the citizens are human beings with their own needs and views
9707,that is why all of them deserve to have an equal say in decisions that affect them
9708,"it means all the citizens aged 18 years and above can vote in an election regardless of his or her caste, religion or gender"
9709,maintaining of voters’ list it is the responsibility of the government to get the names of all the eligible voters put on the voters’ list
9710,"as new persons attain voting age, names are added to the voters’ list, names of those who move out of a place or those who are dead are deleted"
9711,a complete revision of the list takes place every five years
9712,this is done to ensure that it remains up to date
9713,"[note some criminals and persons with unsound mind can be denied the right to vote, but only in rare situations.] election photo identify card (epic) in the last few years, a new system of election photo identity card (epic) has been introduced"

9715,"voters can show many other proofs of identity like the ration card, driving’ licence or adhar card"
9716,nomination of candidates the system of our country provides almost no restrictions on anyone to contest the election
9717,anyone who can be a voter can also become a candidate in elections
9718,the only difference to be a voter is that the minimum age is 18 years while to be a candidate in the election the minimum age is 25 years
9719,there are also some other restrictions on criminals but these apply in very extreme cases
9720,political parties nominate their candidates who get the party support and symbol

9726,educational qualifications for candidates there is no educational qualification for candidates for being an mp or an mla
9727,"however, the relevant qualification for candidates is the ability to understand people’s concerns, problems and to represent people’s interests"
9728,putting an educational qualification would go against the spirit of democracy because it would deprive a majority of the citizens right to contest elections
9729,"this is because still, the majority of the indian population is uneducated"
9730,"election campaign election campaign means the promotion (or propaganda) of the policies, offers and promises that the candidates make to voters to fulfill if they are elected"
9731,"in this way, voters can decide the candidate to vote for"

10620,the steep rocky coast rising almost vertically above seawater is called sea cliff
10621,the landscape is eroded due to glaciers which are rivers of ice
10622,"the material carried by the glacier such as rocks, sand and silt gets deposited and forms glacial moraines"
10623,the wind is an active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts
10624,"when the wind blows, it lifts and transports said from one place to another"
10625,when it stops blowing the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill-like structures known as sand dunes

11563,dalits in india and minorities are denied the right to dignity and equality
11564,equality in indian democracy the indian constitution recognizes every person as equal
11565,"however, it does not mean that inequality does not exist in india"
11566,"universal adult franchise gives political equality, not social and economic equality"
11567,dignity is the thinking or state of being worthy of esteem or respect
11568,"the dignity of an individual is violated on the basis of their caste, religion or gender"
11569,the government has tried to implement equality first through laws and second through government programmes or schemes to help disadvantaged communities
11570,"there is no discrimination on the basis of caste, colour, religion, race, gender; everyone has access to all public places and untouchability has been abolished"
11571,programmes like the mid-day meal scheme have been launched to improve the attendance and enrolment ratio of children in schools
11572,issues of equality in other democracies in the usa also the civil rights movement of the 1960’s restored the dignity of afro-american based on colour
11573,"in a democratic country like india, all adults irrespective of what religion they belong to, how much education they have had, what caste they are, or whether they are rich or poor are given the right to vote, which is called universal adult franchise"
11574,universal adult franchise gives political equality to the people but it does not ensure social and economic equality
11575,she is standing in the queue and is waiting for her turn like others
11576,she is happy that she is equal to all of the others because of each of them lies one vote
11577,it gives her a good feeling that even wealthy and influential persons are standing in the queue
11578,"when kanta has to face the bitter reality of this world, she becomes sure that she is prey to social and economic inequality"
11579,"she cannot compare herself with the members of her saheb’s family, where she works as domestic help"
11580,the only guarantee of voting rights to all adult persons is not the solution of all the problems
11581,there are many people like kanta in our country who have the right to vote but whose daily living and working conditions are far from equality
11582,there are several kinds of inequalities that exist in our country
11583,just take the example of the caste system which has been in existence in india for centuries
11584,"omprakash valmiki is a famous dalit writer who writes about his bitter experience for being a dalit in his autobiography, jonathan"
11585,while other children in his class were studying he was sweeping
11586,they were not given a flat by the landlady simply because they belonged to other religion
11587,"while earlier no law existed to protect people from discrimination, now there are several that work to see that people are treated with dignity and as equals"
11588,what this means is that every person from the president of the country to a domestic help like kanta has to obey the same laws
11589,"no person can be discriminated against on the basis of their religion, race, caste, place of birth etc"
11590,"thus, there are several laws in india that protect every person’s right to be treated equally"
11591,"in addition to laws, the government has also set up several schemes to improve the lives of communities and individuals who have been treated unequally for several centuries"
11592,the midday meal scheme is one of the various steps of the government in this direction
11593,"under the midday meal scheme, all government elementary schools provide children with cooked food"
11594,this scheme has helped increase the enrolment and attendance of poor children in school
11595,"in spite of all these efforts to increase equality of opportunity, there continue to be big differences in our country between schools that the rich attend and those that the poor attend"
11596,there are many democratic countries around the world where the issue of equality continues to be the key issue around which communities struggle
11597,"in the united states of america, the african-american were seriously discriminated against"
11598,in the late 1950s there took place a movement known as the civil rights movement for equal rights for african-americans
11599,"the civil rights act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion or national origin"

11608,"in most families, women are taught that after school they have to get married"
11609,"laxmi lakra, however, broke this stereotype image when she became the first woman engine driver of the northern railways"
11610,if boys do not work hard and get a good salary they are bullied learning for change going to school is an important part of life
11611,"today, it is difficult for us to imagine that school and learning could be seen as out of bounds or not appropriate for some children"
11612,"even in families where skills like pottery, weaving and craft were taught, the contribution of daughters and women was seen as secondary"
11613,"in the nineteenth century, new ideas about learning and education appeared"
11614,but there was a lot of opposition to educating girls ever then
11615,rokeya sakhawat hossain learnt english from her elder brother and an elder sister in spite of family opposition and went on to become a famous writer
11616,rashsundari devi of bengal was the first indian woman to write an autobiography called ‘amar jiban’
11617,schooling and education today today both boys and girls attend school in large numbers
11618,"the difference in their education still remains today education is the right of both boys and girls, despite that only 50 % of the girls receive an education"
11619,india has a census every 10 years which counts the population of the country
11620,"this information is used to measure things like literacy, sex-ratio, etc"
11621,a huge number of sc and st children leave school at an early age
11622,the 2014 census even shows that muslim girls are less likely than dalit girls to complete primary school
11623,"many reasons like non-availability of teachers and schools, lack of transport, cost of education, indifferent attitude of teachers and parents are responsible for the negligence of education"
11624,women’s movement women have individually and collectively struggled to bring about changes
11625,"different strategies have been used to spread awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice"
11626,"these movements are related to campaigning, raising awareness, protesting and showing solidarity"
11627,men and women in society are looked upon as playing specific gender roles
11628,women have been facing inequalities at every step since time immemorial
11629,"no doubt, their position and status have been improved with the change of time, still, they lag behind men in almost every field"
11630,"in this male-dominated society, they fail to avail equal privileges and opportunities"
11631,it has also been seen that some occupations are considered to be more suitable for men than for women
11632,many people believe that women make better nurses because they are more patient and gentle
11633,it is also believed that women do not bear technical mind and therefore they are not capable of dealing with technical things
11634,"thus, they have been stereotyped as good nurses, good teachers, etc"
11635,"they are never seen as army officers, pilots, railway engine drivers, etc"
11636,"it is, therefore, girls do not get the same support that boys do to study and train to become doctors and engineers"
11637,they are determined to break these stereotypes by excelling them in fields which were considered male preserves till now
11638,"we can mention here the name of laxmi lakra who by becoming an engine driver, showed the world that women can do everything"
11639,they are pressurised to think about getting a job that will pay a good salary
11640,it is a matter of great anxiety for the parents if their son shows his inclination towards studying subjects other than science or maths
11641,in our present social set-up parents have developed a false belief that only science and maths are meaningful subjects
11642,one positive change that is visible today is that more and more children have started going to school
11643,"in the past, the skill of reading and writing was known to only a few"
11644,"in communities that taught sons to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn the alphabet"
11645,the communities that never learnt reading and writing started sending their children to school
11646,"in the beginning, there was a lot of opposition jp educating girls"
11647,but there were also women and men who made efforts to open schools for girls
11648,"at that time, it was believed that if a woman learnt to read and write, she would become a widow"
11649,"despite this, she taught herself how to read and write in secret, after her marriage"
11650,"she wrote her autobiography in bangla which titled amar jaban, rokeya sakhawat hossain was another example who did a lot for women’s education"
11651,"she knew how to read and write urdu, but she was stopped from learning bangla and english"
11652,"afterwards, she became a writer and wrote a remarkable story titled sultana’s dream in 1905"
11653,she did a lot to help other girls go to school and to build their own dreams
11654,"in 1910, she started a school for girls in kolkata which is still functioning well"
11655,"no doubt more and more girls have started attending school, still they lag behind boys"
11656,"as per the most recent census of 2001, 76% of boys and men are literate but the figure is comparatively very low in case of girls"
11657,"thus, the percentage of the male group is higher than the female group"
11658,girls who are from dalit and adivasi backgrounds are less likely to remain in school
11659,one of the many reasons is that several families are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating all their children
11660,the position and status of women have undoubtedly improved a lot which is due to the collective efforts of the women of the country
11661,"they used different strategies to spread awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice"
11662,"for example, they organise campaigns to fight discrimination and violence against women"
11663,"violation: when someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect, we often say that he/she has committed a violation"

11672,"most doctors settle in urban areas, while people in rural areas have to travel long distance for medical facilities"
11673,"about 5 lakh people die from tuberculosis every year, while 2 million cases of malaria are reported every year"
11674,"in india, a paradoxical situation exists as health care resources are uneven"
11675,private and public healthcare healthcare is divided into two categories: public health services and private health services
11676,public health services is a chain of health centres and hospitals run by the government
11677,one important aspect of public health is that it is meant to provide quality healthcare services either free or at a low cost so that even the poor can seek treatment
11678,private health services are not owned or controlled by the government
11679,people have to pay a lot of money for every service that they use
11680,"healthcare and equality in india, private health services are increasing but public health services are not"
11681,"as the cost of these private services is high, many people cannot afford them"
11682,barely 20% of the indian population can afford medicines that they require during an illness
11683,"it is the responsibility of the government to provide quality healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the poor and the disadvantaged"
11684,"in 1996, kerala decentralized its health budget at panchayati level to ensure effective health planning"
11685,the best example of healthcare comes from costa rica where the government provides for adequate healthcare to people
11686,"in a democratic country, it is the expectation of the people that government work for their welfare through the provision of education, health, employment, etc"
11687,health is a vital aspect because only healthy people can prove themselves resourceful
11688,health means our ability to remain free of illness and injuries
11689,"apart from disease, we need to think of other factors such as clean drinking water, pollution-free surroundings etc"
11690,adequate food is also essential for keeping ourselves in good health
11691,"thus, good health includes both a sound mind and sound body"
11692,"healthcare facilities include health centres, hospitals, laboratories for test, ambulance services, blood banks, etc"
11693,"in order to run such facilities, we need health workers, nurses, qualified doctors, etc"
11694,we also need medicines and equipment that are essential for treating patients
11695,"perhaps, therefore, a large number of medical tourists come to our country for treatment at a reasonable cost"
11696,india is the fourth largest producer of medicines in the world and is also a large exporter of medicines
11697,"despite all this, the health situation in our country is very poor"
11698,the reason is that the government fails to make necessary healthcare available to all
11699,healthcare facilities can be divided into two categories—public health services and private health facilities
11700,the public health service is a chain of health centres and hospitals run by the government
11701,"at the village level, there are health centres where there is usually a nurse and a village health worker"
11702,at the district level is the district hospital that supervises all the health centres
11703,"under the public health system, quality health care services are provided either free or at a low cost, so that even the poor can seek treatment"
11704,"under this system, the action is also taken to prevent the spread of diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, jaundice, cholera, diarrhoea, chikungunya, etc"
11705,a wide range of private health facilities exists in our country
11706,"in the rural areas, registered medical practitioners (rmps) are found whereas in the urban areas a large number of doctors can be seen"
11707,"there are hospitals and nursing homes that are privately owned, and not run by the government"
11708,"unlike public health services in private hospitals, patients have to pay a lot of money for their treatment"
11709,"in our country, private services are increasing but public sen/ices are not"
11710,"as the private sen/ices are run for profit, the cost of these services is rather high"
11711,only 20% of the population can afford all the medicines that they require during illness
11712,it has been found that 40% of people who are admitted to a hospital for some illness have to borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses
11713,as they are undernourished and live in unhygienic conditions they frequently fall ill
11714,"thus, we can say without a doubt that the health situation of most people in our country is not good"
11715,"however, kerala has made efforts to provide adequate healthcare to people of the state"
11716,it is considered to be one of the healthiest countries in the continent
11717,"the costa rican government curtailed the expenses on the army to spend it on health, education and other basic needs of the people"
11718,"it provides them with safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition and housing"
11719,medical tourists: the foreigners who come to our country for medical treatment at hospitals that change the reasonable cost
11720,"communicable diseases: diseases that spread from one person to another through water, food, air, etc"
11721,public: a service that is meant for all people in the country and is organised by the government
11722,private: a service that is organised by an individual or company for their own profit
11723,this is where people are first brought in and treated in a hospital without being admitted to any special ward

11727,"as people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop"
11728,the idea that all human beings are not equal at birth gained ground during this period
11729,the idea of a supreme god who could deliver humans from bondage through devotion or bhakti emerged
11730,"gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with shiva, vishnu or durga"
11731,"a new kind of bhakti in south india – nayanars and alvars the seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of a new religious movement, led by nayanars (saints devoted to shiva) and alvars (saints devoted to vishnu)"
11732,they were sharply critical of the buddhists and jainas and preached ardent love of shiva or vishnu as the path to salvation
11733,the nayanars and alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems of praise of the deities enshrined in the village they visited and set them to music
11734,the chola and pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines

11737,basavanna’s virashaivism virashaivism movement was initiated by basavanna and his companions allama prabhu and akkamahadevi in karnataka in the mid-12 century
11738,"they argued strongly for equality of all human beings, opposed brahmanical ideas on caste and treatment of women"
11739,"the saints of maharashtra jnaneshwar, namdev, eknath, tukaram, sakkubai and the family of chokhamela focused on the bhakti of vitthala (a form of vishnu)"
11740,"they rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth"
11741,"nathpanthis, siddhas and yogis a number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticized the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments"
11742,islam and sufism islam propagated monotheism or submission to one god
11743,the sufis rejected the elaborate codes of behaviour demanded by muslim religious scholars
11744,"the sought unison with god, as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world"
11745,"among the great sufis of central asia were ghazzali, rumi and sadi"
11746,sufism introduced many popular orders or silsilas of which the most widespread was the shariat and chisti silsilas
11747,"a long line of teachers included khwaja moinuddin chisti of ajmer, qutbuddin bakhtiyar kaki of delhi, baba farid of punjab, khwaja nizamuddin auliya of delhi and bandanawaz gisudaraz of gulbarga"
11748,new religious developments in north india the period after the 13th century saw a new wave of bhakti movement in north india
11749,"this wave was led by scholars like tulsidas, surdas, kabir and baba guru nanak this tradition also included saints like dadu dayal, ravidas and mirabai"

12268,"since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful"
12269,the factors for which variety of improvement is done are: higher yield: to increase the productivity of the crop per acre
12270,improved quality: the quality of crop products vary from crop to crop
12271,"e.g., the protein quality is important in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds, preserving quality in fruits and vegetables"
12272,"biotic and abiotic resistance: biotic factors are the diseases, insects and nematodes while abiotic factors are the drought, salinity, waterlogging, heat, cold and frost which affect the crop productivity"
12273,varieties resistant to these factors (stresses) can be improved to increase crop production
12274,change in maturity duration: shorter maturity period of crop reduces the cost of crop production and makes the variety economical
12275,uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting
12276,wider adaptability: it allows the crops to be grown under different climatic conditions in different areas
12277,"desirable agronomic characteristics: it increases productivity, for example, tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops; while dwarfness is desired in cereals, so that less nutrients are consumed by these crops"
12278,"plant nutrients: nutrients are supplied to plants by air, water and soil"
12279,air supplies carbon and oxygen; hydrogen comes from water and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants
12280,"amongst these thirteen nutrients, six are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients"
12281,the other seven nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients
12282,"nutrients supplied by air, water and soil manure: manure contains large quantities of organic matter and also supplies small quantities of nutrients to the soil"
12283,manure is prepared by the decomposition of animal excreta and plant waste
12284,manure helps in enriching soil with nutrients and organic matter and increasing soil fertility
12285,"on the basis of the kind of biological waste used to make manure, it can be classified into three types: (i) compost (ii) vermicompost (iii) green manure"
12286,"(i) compost: it can be farm waste material such as livestock excreta (cow dung etc.), vegetable waste, animal refuse, domestic waste, sewage waste, straw, eradicated weeds,etc"
12287,this material is decomposed in pits and this process of decomposition is also called composting
12288,(ii) vermicompost: the compost which is made by the decomposition of plant and animal refuse with the help of redworm is called vermicompost
12289,"(iii) green manure: prior to the sowing of the crop seeds, some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into the soil"
12290,these green plants thus turn into green manure which helps in enriching the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus
12291,"they are used to ensure good vegetative growth (leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants"
12292,fertilizers are an important factor in the higher yields of high-cost farming
12293,"organic farming: it is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc"
12294,"and with a maximum input of organic manures, recycled farm-wastes (straw and livestock excreta), use of bio-agents such as culture of blue-green algae in preparation of biofertilizers, neem leaves or turmeric specifically in grain storage as bio-pesticides with healthy cropping systems [mixed cropping inter-cropping and crop rotation]"
12295,"these cropping systems are beneficial in insect, pest and weed control besides providing nutrients"
12296,irrigation: proper irrigation is very important for the success of crops
12297,"ensuring that the crop gets water at the right stages during their growing season, can increase the expected*yield of a crop"
12298,"different kinds of irrigation systems include wells, canals, rivers and tanks"
12299,wells: these are of two types namely dug wells and tube wells
12300,"in a dug well, water is collected from water bearing strata"
12301,"river lift system: in areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular axle to inadequate reservoir release, the lift system is more rational"
12302,water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers
12303,"tanks: these are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas"
12304,cropping patterns: it includes different ways of growing crops so as to get the maximum benefit
12305,"these different ways include the following: mixed cropping: mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower"
12306,this reduces disease risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops
12307,inter-cropping: it involves growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in definite proportion or pattern
12308,"a few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger millet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia)"
12309,the crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different
12310,"this ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field"
12311,crop rotation: the growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre¬planned succession is known as crop rotation
12312,"depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations"
12313,the availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest
12314,"if crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a,year with good harvest"
12315,"the food requirements of dairy animals are of two types: (a) maintenance requirement which is the food required to support the animals to live a healthy life, and (b) milk producing requirement, which is the type of food required during the lactation period"
12316,"weeds: weeds are unwanted plants in the cultivated field, for example, xanthium (gokhroo), parthenium (gazar ghas) and cyprinus rotundus (motha)"
12317,weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop
12318,"therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest"
12319,methods of weed control: the most effective method is mechanical removal
12320,"preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, finely sowing of crops, inter-cropping and crop-rotation also help in weed control"
12321,"insect pests: generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: they cut the root, stem and leaf, they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and they bore into stem and fruits"
12322,they thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields
12323,preventive measures against pest include: the use of disease resistant varieties
12324,"summer ploughing: in this method, fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy both pests as well as weeds"
12325,"it includes various aspects such as feeding, breeding and disease control"
12326,"milk-producing females are called milch animals (dairy animals), while the one used for farm labour are called draught animals"
12327,"animal feed includes: roughage, which is large, fibre and concentration which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of protein and other nutrients"
12328,"the improved poultry breeds are developed for the following desirable traits: number and quality, of chicks"
12329,reduction in the size of the egg-laying bird with the ability to utilise more fibrous cheaper diets formulated using agricultural by-products
12330,"production of poultry birds: for good production of poultry birds, good management practices are important"
12331,"these include maintenance of temperature and hygenic conditions in housing and poultry feed, as well as prevention and control of diseases and pests"
12332,"the housing, nutritional and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhere different from those of egg layers"
12333,the ration (daily food requirement) for broilers is protein rich with adequate fat
12334,the level of vitamins a and k is kept high in the poultry feeds
12335,"the other way is by fish farming, which is called culture fishery"
12336,"popular marine fish varieties include pomphret, mackerel, tuna, sardines and bombay duck"
12337,"marine fish of high economic value includes mullets, bhetki pearl spots, prawns, mussels and oysters"
12338,"as marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture"
12339,"fish resources are of two types: freshwater resources such as canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers"
12340,brackish water resources (where sea water and fresh water mix together) such as estuaries and lagoons
12341,more extensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems
12342,both local and imported fish species are used in such systems
12343,"in such a system, a combination of five or six species is used in a single fish pond"
12344,these species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits
12345,"as a result, the food available in all parts of the pond is used"

13555,"some rocks consist of a single mineral, e.g., limestone while most rocks consist of several minerals"
13556,the term ‘ore’ is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements
13557,"in igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks, faults or joints by getting solidified in them"
13558,"the smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger lodes, e.g., metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc and lead, etc"
13559,"they are formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata"
13560,"some sedimentary minerals are formed as a result of evaporation, especially in arid regions, e.g., gypsum, potash and salt"
13561,"another mode of formation involves decomposition of surface rocks and the removal of soluble contents, leaving a residual mass of weathered material containing ores"
13562,"certain minerals occur as alluvial deposits in sands of valley floors and the base of hills, e.g., gold, silver, tin and platinum"
13563,these are called placer deposits and contain minerals which are not corroded by water
13564,"ocean waters contain vast quantities of minerals, e.g., common salt, magnesium and bromide are largely derived from the ocean waters"
13565,two best ores are: magnetite—it is the finest iron ore available with upto 70% iron content
13566,it has excellent magnetic qualities and is especially valuable in the electrical industry

13575,bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates
13576,"leading state of bauxite production is odisha, producing 45% of the total bauxite of india"
13577,the most important bauxite deposits are found in panchpatmali in koraput district
13578,mica is made up of a series of plates or leaves
13579,it splits easily into such thin sheets that a thousand put together are only a few centimeters thick
13580,mica is indispensable for electric and electronic industry because it has — excellent di-electric strength; low power loss factor; insulating properties; and resistance to high voltage
13581,mica deposits are found in the northern edge of chhota nagpur plateau
13582,"dangers involved in mining are— the risk of collapsing mine roofs; inundation, i.e., flooding in mines; fires in coal-mines is a constant threat to miners; and poisonous gases, dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases"
13583,conservation of minerals is necessary because: the formation of minerals takes a long geological period of millions of years
13584,the rate of replenishment of minerals is infinitely small in comparison to rate of consumption
13585,methods of mineral conservation: we should use minerals in a planned and sustainable manner
13586,improved technologies need to be evolved to allow use of low grade ores at low cost
13587,"conventional sources include coal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity (both hydel and thermal)"
13588,all these sources have been in use for quite some time
13589,non-conventional sources of energy are relatively new sources as their large scale generation has started recently
13590,coal as an important source of energy: it provides a substantial part of the nation’s energy needs as it is abundantly available

13622,the flow of water is used to run the turbine to generate electricity
13623,a 900 mw tidal energy power plant is set up by the national hydropower corporation in the gulf of kuchchh
13624,geo thermal energy: we know that the inside of the earth is very hot
13625,"at some places, this heat is released on the surface through fissures"
13626,groundwater in such areas becomes hot and rises up in the form of steam
13627,two geo thermal energy projects—the parvati valley near manikam in himachal pradesh and the puga valley in ladakh
13628,"it is needed to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel vehicles and to drive machinery in industries"
13629,"every sector of national economy—agriculture, industry, transport and commerce needs greater inputs of energy"
13630,"energy demands, in the form of electricity, are growing because of increasing use of electrical gadgets and appliances"
13631,ways to conserve energy: using more of public transport system instead of individual vehicles
13632,"switching off electrical devices when not in use, using power saving devices"

13752,companies who set up production units in sezs are exempted from taxes for an initial period of five years
13753,sezs thus help to attract foreign companies to invest in india
13754,reasons to put barriers to foreign trade: the indian government after independence had put barriers to foreign trade and investment
13755,this was done to protect the producers within the country from foreign competition
13756,industries were just coming up in the 1950s and 1960s and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed these industries to develop and grow
13757,"imports of only essential items such as machinery, fertilizers, petroleum etc"
13758,to protect the indian economy from foreign infiltration in industries affecting the economic growth of the country as planned
13759,india wanted to move faster to catch up with the main industries in the world market and therefore had to keep an extra watch on its progress in international trade and give incentives to the more rapidly growing industries through fiscal tariff and other means
13760,"around 1991, some changes were made in policy by the indian government as it was decided that the time had come for the indian producers to compete with foreign producers"
13761,this would not only help the indian producers to improve their performance but also improve their quality
13762,liberalization means the removal of barriers and restrictions set by the government on foreign trade
13763,governments use trade barriers to increase or decrease (regulate) foreign trade to protect the domestic industries from foreign competition

13768,"mncs set up production in various countries based on the following factors: mncs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources; e.g., in countries like china, bangladesh and india"
13769,"at times, mncs set up production jointly with some of the local companies of countries around the world"
13770,the benefit of such joint production to the local company is two-fold
13771,"first, the mncs can provide money for additional investments for faster production"
13772,"secondly, the mncs bring with them the latest technology for enhancing and improving production"
13773,some mncs are so big that their wealth exceeds the entire budgets of some developing countries
13774,this is the reason why they buy up local companies to expand production
13775,"example, cargill foods, an american mnc has bought over small indian company such as parakh foods"
13776,"mncs control production by placing orders for production with small producers in developing nations; e.g., garments, footwear, sports items etc"
13777,the products are supplied to these mncs which then sell these under their own brand name to customers
13778,development in information and communication technology has also helped a great deal
13779,"telecommunication facilities — telegraph, telephone (including mobile phones), fax are now used to contact one another quickly around the world"
13780,information technology has also played an important role in spreading out production of services across countries

13815,any legal change must carefully look at what results it will have on politics
13816,"generally, laws, that seek a ban on something are rather counter-productive; for example, many states have debarred people who have more than two children from contesting panchayat elections"
13817,"this has resulted in denial of democratic opportunity to many poor women, which was not intended"
13818,"the best laws are those which empower people to carry out democratic reforms; for example, the right to information act which acts as a watchdog of democracy by controlling corruption"

13887,altitude or height above sea level climate also varies according to the altitude
13888,climates in india the climate of india varies in different regions
13889,these can be described as below: the northern region of himalayas has cold and moderately wet climate (e.g
13890,assam) and receives rain for a major part of the year
13891,"climate and adaptation the ability of an organism to develop certain features which improve the chances of its survival in the environment in which they live, is known as adaptation"
13892,animals are adapted to survive in the conditions in which they live
13893,"in other words, an adaptation is a trait of an organism that has been favoured by natural selection"
13894,"adaptations are of three types: (i) structural adaptations adaptation of special body parts of an organism that helps it to survive in its natural habitat, e.g"
13895,(ii) behavioural adaptations adaptation of special ways in a particular organism that helps it to survive in its natural habitat
13896,frogs and bear undergoes hibernation or winter sleep during hard winter season
13897,"(iii) physiological adaptations adaptation of body systems presents in an organism that allows it to perform the certain biochemical reaction, e.g"
13898,animals that live in a very cold or hot climate must possess special features to protect themselves against extreme cold or heat
13899,the features and habits that help an animal to adapt to their surrounding are a result of the process of evolution
13900,these animals may be grouped as polar region and tropical rainforest animals
13901,"the polar regions the polar regions as the name suggest are situated near the poles, i.e"
13902,"the countries that belong to the polar regions are canada, greenland, iceland, norway, sweden, finland, alaska in usa and siberian region of russia"
13903,polar regions show’ extremely colder climate which is covered with snow and remain cold for most part of the year
13904,"in this region, the sun does not set for six months and even does not rise for other six months"
13905,"the temperature goes down below -37°c, during winters in polar regions"
13906,the ground remains frozen most of the year and water becomes available only during the short summer when snow melts
13907,"animals living in these regions are adapted in different ways to cope with the conditions of temperature, light and moisture and also according to the availability of food in that region"
13908,polar bears and penguins are the animals that live in polar region
13909,"besides these whales, seals are the other animals are also found in polar regions"
13910,"some fishes, foxes, musk oxen, reindeer and birds also live in polar regions"
13911,adaptations in polar bear polar bear is a large and white bear that lives in the north polar region of the earth
13912,the polar bear mainly feeds on fishes and seal and can survive in the extremely cold climate of polar regions due to the following adaptations: (i) their body is covered by a thick coat of white fur
13913,it helps them to blend with their surrounding snow white back ground and cannot be noticed by their predators
13914,beneath the fur is a thick coat of fat which insulates the body from cold and keeps the bear warm
13915,(ii) a polar bear is a good swimmer which has wide and large paws that help it to swim
13916,these paws also help bear to walk on the snow easily
13917,(iii) they have a strong sense of smell so that they can locate their prey easily
13918,they also possess small ears to keep the body surface area to the minimum and reduce the heat loss from the body
13919,(iv) the thick layer of fat beneath the skin also stores food in winter when food is scarce
13920,this stored food (fat) also helps the mother polar bear to survive in the winter when they undergo hibernation beneath the snow with their newborn cubs
13921,adaptations in penguins another well-known animal living in the polar regions is the penguin which can survive due to the following adaptations: (i) these are black and white in colour which merges well with the white background of ice and snow
13922,(ii) they have thick skin and a thick layer of fat below their skin which protects them from extreme cold

13925,"migration migration is the seasonal journey taken by different animals or birds to escape the extreme climatic condition and the search of food, e.g"
13926,siberian cranes migrates towards warmer region in the autumn by travelling several thousands of kilometers
13927,"bharatpur, rajasthan and sultanpur, haryana and sometimes in wetland of north-east and other parts of india"
13928,migratory birds / sometimes travel as much as 15000 km to escape the extreme climatic condition of their habitat
13929,these birds fly high where the wind flow is helpful and cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight muscles
13930,these birds have a built in sense of direction and know in which direction they have to travel
13931,some birds are guided by the sun during daytime and by stars during night
13932,some birds can use the magnetic field of the earth to fnd the direction
13933,"besides birds some fishes, insects and mammals also migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates"
13934,the tropical rainforest the tropical region lies near both the sides of equator line on the earth
13935,"even in coldest month, the temperature is generally higher than about 15°c"
13936,days and nights are almosts equal in length throughout the year
13937,these regions are rich in vegetation and large diversity in animals is also seen in this region
13938,"in india, tropical rainforests are found in western ghats and assam, other countries of the world like south, east asia, central america, malaysia, indonesia, brazil, republic of congo, kenya, uganda, nigeria and central africa also have tropical rainforest"
13939,"the major type of animals living in the rainforest are monkeys, apes, gorillas, tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards, snakes, birds and insects"
13940,"since, there are large number of animals found in these regions"
13941,there is an intense competition for food and shelter among these animals
13942,"so, the animals are adapted in such a way that they eat different kinds of food and live in different kinds of places to overcome competition for food and shelter respectively"
13943,the adaptations in different animals living in tropical rainforests can be discussed as follows: adaptations in red-eyed frog the red-eyed frog lives on trees in tropical rainforest
13944,they have sticky pads on their feet that help them to climb trees
13945,it does not live in water and has a green back and a creamy underside
13946,it has big and bulging bright-red eyes and it is a nocturnal
13947,it sleeps during the day and becomes active during night and feeds on the insects present on the tree
13948,the sudden opening of big and bright-red eyes frightens the predator for a while and in the meantime the frog gets time to jump to a safe place
13949,the green colour of the frog helps it to hide within the green leaves of the tree and helps it to protect from predators
13950,adaptations in monkey the monkeys living in tropical rainforests have long tails for grasping branches
13951,their hands and feet are adapted in such a way that they can easily hold the branches of trees
13952,the eyesight of monkeys is very good which helps them in leaping between the branches to escape from their predators
13953,"monkeys eat fruits, seeds, leaves, root and insects as their food which is present in abundance in tropical rainforest"
13954,adaptations in lion-tailed macaque it is also called as beard ape and lives in the rainforest of western chats in india
13955,it has silver-white mane which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin which is the specific characteristic of this animal
13956,it is called lion-tailed because its tail is like that of lion having bunch or tuft of hair at the end
13957,they spend most of their time feeding in the upper canopy of trees (i.e
13958,"it mainly feeds on fruits, seeds, young leaves, stems, flowers and buds"
13959,they also can eat insects present under the bark of the tree
13960,it rarely comes down on the ground and spends a major part of its life on the tree
13961,it is a good climber with its hand and feet adapted to hold the branches of trees firmly
13962,"adaptation in toucan toucan is a bird, which is found in tropical rainforest and which possesses a long strong and large beak"
13963,it lives most of the time in the holes of big trees
13964,the long and large beak helps toucan to reach the fruits attached to the ends of even thin branches of tree that are weak enough to support its weight
13965,it is an adaptation of this bird to get the unreachable fruits
13966,its large beak also helps in temporary storage of fruits which is collected by toucan
13967,these possess feet that are adapted for grasping the branches of trees firmly
13968,"toucan can change the colour of its feather, so as to get mixed up with the surrounding and they are not easily noticed by predators and remain safe"
13969,adaptations in lion and tiger these are also called as big cats and are carnivore which eat only flesh of other animals
13970,"these have following adaptations to survive in tropical rainforest: they have thick skin and skin colour helps them to camouflage (ability of the animal to match their surrounding, e.g"
13971,the yellow brown colour of lion and black stripes of tiger helps them to hide in the forest by blending with the surroundings
13972,they have strong sense of smell which helps them to locate their prey
13973,they have eyes in front of their head which enable them to have a correct idea of the location of their prey
13974,"their strong legs help them to run fast and long, sharp and strong claws in front of their legs help them to catch and tear their prey"
13975,adaptations in elephant elephant is a well-known animal of indian tropical rainforest
13976,these are plant eaters and are adapted in many remarkable ways to survive in tropical rainforest
13977,these adaptations can be discussed as follows: (i) the elephant has a long trunk which is used as nose and has a strong sense of smell
13978,it can reach up to the branches of trees and help it to eat tree leaves
13979,it is used for sucking water from lakes or rivers (drinking)
13980,(ii) the elephant possesses tusks (long pointed teeth) that are used in tearing the bark of trees which the elephant loves to eat as food
13981,it also helps elephant to fight their enemies and protecting themselves
13982,(iii) the elephant has large ears that help it to hear even very soft sounds and can sense the danger
13983,it also helps the elephant to keep it cool in the hot and humid climate of the tropical forest
13984,(iv) the feet of the elephant is large and round which help it to provide good stability and also prevent it from sinking into soft ground due to its heavy weight

13987,"substances like lemon juice, orange juice, unripe mango and curd taste sour"
13988,they taste sour because they contain substances called acids in them
13989,"however, there are other substances like baking soda it does not taste sour"
13990,"and if prepare a solution of baking soda in water and rub it between your fingers, it feels soapy"
13991,substance like these which are bitter in taste and feel soapy on touch are known as bases
13992,the chemical nature of such substances is said to be basic
13993,there are some special substances that have different colours in acidic and basic mediums
13994,the indicators change their colour when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance
13995,"some naturally occurring indicators are litmus, turmeric, china rose petals (gudhal) and red cabbage juice"
13996,they are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic in nature
13997,litmus is obtained from certain lichens (small plants) and used as a dilute solution
13998,"when it is added to a basic solution, it turns blue"
13999,"usually, it is available as a red and blue litmus paper"
14000,turmeric is another natural indicator turmeric is a bright yellow powder obtained from a plant
14001,it is used as indicator in the form of turmeric paper
14002,china rose as an indicator china rose is a natural indicator
14003,it is a extracted from the red flowers of china rose plant with water
14004,acid rain the rain containing excess of acids called an acid rain
14005,"the rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively"
14006,"it can cause damage to buildings, historical monuments, plants and animals"
14007,"this happens as follows: acid rain makes the water of lakes, ponds and rivers too acidic due to which fish and other aquatic animals get killed"
14008,"acid rain damages the metal structures like steel bridges, etc when it falls on them"
14009,acid rain damages the surfaces of buildings and monuments made up of marble
14010,"so, when an acid is mixed with a base, they neutralise (or cancel) the effect of each other"
14011,"when an acid solution and a base solution are mixed in suitable amounts, both the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature of the base are destroyed"
14012,"so, the reaction between an acid and base is known as neutralisation"
14013,"in the process of neutralisation, salt and water are produced with the evolution of heat"
14014,"salt produced in the reaction may be acidic, basic or neutral in nature"
14015,acid + base → salt + water (heat is evolved) e.g
14016,"hydrochloric acid (hcl) (acid) + sodium hydroxide (naoh) (base) → sodium chloride (nacl) (salt) + water (h2o) if dilute sulphuric acid is added to lime water (which is a base), then neutralisation reaction takes place and the reaction mixture becomes hot"
14017,we are going to use an indicator which you have not used so far
14018,"when the solution is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink colour but if the solution is acidic, it remains colourless"
14019,neutralisations in everyday life the neutralisation reactions involving acids and bases play a very important role in our everyday life
14020,"the treatment of an ant’s sting, remedy for indigestion, soil treatment and the treatment of factory wastes, all involve neutralisation reaction"
14021,"sometimes, excess of hydrochloric acid is produced in the stomach which causes indigestion"
14022,"due to indigestion, sometimes a person feels pain in the stomach and irritation"
14023,"to relieve indigestion, we take an antacid such as milk of magnesia"
14024,magnesium hydroxide neutralises the excess acid present in the stomach and cures indigestion
14025,another antacid is baking soda which contains a base sodium hydrogen carbonate
14026,"ant bite when an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid into the skin of the person which causes burning pain"
14027,the sting of an ant contains an acid called formic acid
14028,the effect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing a mild base like baking soda solution (sodium hydrogen carbonate) or calamine solution
14029,"thus, being a base, baking soda solution or calamine solution neutralises the acidic liquid injected by the ant and cancels its effect"
14030,"the plants do not grow well, if the soil at a place is too acidic or too basic"
14031,"when the soil is too acidic, it is treated with bases like quicklime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide)"
14032,these bases neutralise the excess acid present in the soil and reduce its acidic nature
14033,"if the soil is basic, organic matter called manure or compost is added to it"
14034,the organic matter releases acids which neutralise the excess bases present in the soil and reduce its basic nature
14035,factory wastes the waste substances discharged by many factories contain acids
14036,"if these factory wastes are allowed to flow into the water bodies (like rivers, ponds, lakes, etc), then the acid present in them will kill fish and other organisms which live in the water bodies"
14037,the factory wastes are therefore neutralised by adding basic substances before discharging them into water bodies

14040,cells all living organisms are made from small building units of catted cells
14041,cells are the structural and functional units of the body of all living organisms
14042,"the cell has a thin outer boundary called cell membrane, a distinct, centrally located spherical structure called nucleus and jelly-the substance surrounding the nucleus called cytoplasm"
14043,co2 is taken from the air through the tiny pores present on the surface of leaves called stomata and water is absorbed through the roots of plants (from the soil) and is transported to leaves by vessels which act like pipes
14044,these vessels form the continuous path from roots to leaves for the movement of nutrients
14045,green plants possess chlorophyll in their leaves which captures the energy of the sunlight
14046,photosynthesis is the unique process in which solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plants in the form of food
14047,"thus, ‘sun is the ultimate source of energy for all the living organisms.’ products of photosynthesis the food produced by the process of photosynthesis is mainly carbohydrate"
14048,it produces glucose as food material which later gets converted into starch
14049,the presence of starch in leaves indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis
14050,"importance of photosynthesis if the plants do not perform photosynthesis, there would be no food on earth"
14051,photosynthesis is also necessary for the production of oxygen gas in the atmosphere which is necessary for the respiration of organisms
14052,"therefore, it can be said that no life is possible in the absence of photosynthesis"
14053,"photosynthesis in leaves of various colours in green pants, chlorophyll absorbs light energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis"
14054,"besides some green colour plants like croton, maple, colocasia, etc., have leaves that are red, brown, violet colour (variegated)"
14055,these colours are present in large amounts and masks the green colour of chlorophyll in leaves
14056,"thus, these leaves also perform photosynthesis and synthesise starch in them"
14057,"synthesis of plant food other than carbohydrates the starch or glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrate synthesised by the plants which is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen"
14058,"sometimes these simplest forms of carbohydrate are utilised to synthesise other food nutrients like fats (oils), proteins, etc"
14059,"starch or glucose is rich in seeds like wheat, rice and various parts of plants like potato tuber"
14060,"sometimes the starch or glucose is stored in the form of oil in their seeds (oilseed), e.g"
14061,"when the plant nutrient contains, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen along with nitrogen elements, it is called protein"
14062,the element nitrogen comes from soil in the form of nitrate by the actions of some bacteria present in soil and forms amino acid which is then converted into proteins
14063,"other modes of nutrition in plants there are some plants which do not contain chlorophyll in them and thus, cannot prepare their own food"
14064,"these plants obtain their food from other plants or animal, i.e"
14065,parasitic plants a parasitic plant is one that lines inside or outside the other organism and derive their food from them
14066,"the plant (non-green) which obtains their food from other organism is called a parasite and the living organism from whose body, food is obtained is called host, e.g"
14067,it takes readymade food from host through special type of roots called sucking roots which penetrate into host plant and suck food material from the host
14068,insectivorous plants there are some plants which can trap insects and digest them for their nutrition
14069,"these have specialised leaves, the apex of which forms a lid that can open and close the mouth of pitcher"
14070,there are hair inside the pitcher which are used to entangle the insects
14071,"when an insect comes in contact of the lid, it gets closed and traps the insects"
14072,the insect inside the pitcher is digested by digestive juices secreted by the pitcher to obtain nitrogen compounds (amino acids) from them
14073,"since these can synthesise their own food but fulfil their nitrogen deficiency by eating insects, therefore these are called as partial heterotrophs"
14074,saprotrophic plants the mode of nutrition in which organisms take their nutrients from dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition
14075,"plants which use the saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs, e.g"
14076,fungi like mushrooms are non-green plants that grow on the dead and decaying matter for their food
14077,"symbiotic plants sometimes, two plants of different species live together and help each other in obtaining food and shelter"
14078,this association is called symbiosis and such plants are called symbiotic plants
14079,"the relationship in which two different organisms live together and share shelter and nutrients is called symbiotic relationship, e.g"
14080,lichen is an association in which algae and a fungus live together
14081,"the fungus provides shelter, water and minerals to the algae and in return, the algae provide food which it prepares by photosynthesis"
14082,replenishment of nutrients in soil crops require a lot of nitrogen to make proteins
14083,plants cannot use the nitrogen gas available in the atmosphere directly
14084,the action of certain bacteria can convert this nitrogen into a form readily used by plants
14085,these bacteria take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and convert it into water-soluble nitrogen compounds making it available to the leguminous plants for their growth
14086,"in return, leguminous plants provide food and shelter to the bacteria as rhizobium cannot prepare its food"
14087,"this association is very important for the farmers, as they do not need to add nitrogen fertilisers to the soil in which leguminous plants are grown"

14090,"just above the bulb containing mercury, a clinical thermometer has a kink in its glass tube which is to prevent the back flow of mercury into the thermometer bulb when the thermometer bulb is removed from the mouth of a patient"
14091,this kink prevents the mercury level in the thermometer tube from falling on its own
14092,"due to this, we can read the correct body temperature of the patient even after removing the thermometer bulb from his mouth"
14093,"note: after noting the body temperature, the level of mercury can be brought down by giving jerk to the thermometer tube"
14094,"as mercury is very toxic and is difficult to dispose off, so thermometer must be handled carefully"
14095,clinical thermometer should not be used to measure the temperature of objects other than the human body
14096,"it should not be kept in the sun or near a flame, otherwise, it may break"
14097,reading a clinical thermometer there are following steps to read the temperature on a thermometer
14098,"step i: firstly, wash the thermometer with an antiseptic solution and if in case, the antiseptic solution is not available, then wash it with clean water"
14099,"step ii: gently, hold the thermometer tube in your hand and give it a jerk in such a way that the mercury thread in the thermometer tube falls below the reading of 35°c"
14100,"step iii: now, put the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue of the patient for about one minute"
14101,"step iv: in order to read the temperature, hold the thermometer horizontally in your hand and rotate it slowly"
14102,"when we see a magnified image of the mercury thread in its tube, then a position will come"
14103,"now, read the temperature on thermometer tube in level with the top of the mercury thread"
14104,precautions while reading the thermometer a clinical thermometer should not be used for any object other than the human body
14105,there are some following precautions which are to be observed while reading a clinical thermometer
14106,wash the clinical thermometer before and after using preferably with an antiseptic solution
14107,be ensure that the mercury level before using the clinical thermometer should be below 35°c
14108,the clinical thermometer should be read by keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight
14109,"while reading the clinical thermometer, it should never be held by the bulb"
14110,laboratory thermometer a device which is used for measuring the temperature in a science laboratory is called a laboratory thermometer
14111,this thermometer is made up of a long glass tube having a thin bore
14112,"the graduation marked on the tube of a laboratory thermometer can measure the temperature from -10°c to 110°c, this is known as the range of a laboratory thermometer"
14113,"also, determine how much a small division on this thermometer reads (this is also known as least count of the thermometer), it is due to the fact that this information is required to read the thermometer correctly"
14114,these are the special thermometers which automatically record the maximum and minimum temperature of the day
14115,the maximum s and minimum temperature of the last day reported in weather reports in tv and newspapers are measured by the maximum-minimum thermometers
14116,reading a laboratory thermometer there are following steps to read the temperature on a thermometer
14117,"step i: first of all, take some hot water in a beaker"
14118,"step ii: now, try to hold the laboratory thermometer from its glass tube and immerse the bulb of the thermometer in hot water taken in the beaker"
14119,notice that the bulb of the thermometer should not touch the sides or the bottom of the beaker as shown in the figure
14120,"step iii: here, we will observe the shining thread of mercury moving up in the thermometer tube"
14121,"after some time, the mercury will stop rising and stand at one place"
14122,"now, read the temperature on the thermometer tube which corresponds to the top of the mercury thread"
14123,this will give us the temperature of hot water taken in the beaker
14124,"note: to measure the human body temperature a laboratory thermometer cannot be used because as soon as we tahe out the bulb of the laboratory thermometer from the mouth of a patient, the mercury level wilt starts falling quickly (due to cooling of its bulb by air)"
14125,"so, this will provide a wrong value of the body temperature"
14126,"precautions in using a laboratory thermometer while -measuring temperature, the laboratory thermometer should be held vertically"
14127,the thermometer bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance whose temperature is to be measured
14128,the thermometer reading should be taken while its bulb is still in touch with the substance whose temperature is being measured and by keeping the mercury level along the line of sight
14129,"we should note down the temperature reading by keeping the thermometer bulb immersed in hot water because if the thermometer bulb is taken out of hot water, then its mercury thread will start falling and this will give a wrong reading for the temperature of hot water"
14130,digital thermometer there are most of the common thermometers like mercury thermometers which use a liquid metal called mercury for their working
14131,"mercury is a toxic substance (a poisonous substance) and thus it is very difficult to dispose of safely, if a thermometer breaks"
14132,"so, there is a lot of concern over the use of mercury in thermometers"
14133,"also, during these days, digital thermometers are available which do not use mercury"
14134,transfer of heat heat flows from a hot object to a cold object or heat flows from an object at the higher temperature to another object which is at a lower temperature
14135,"this flow of heat is known as the transfer of heat, e.g"
14136,"if you dip a steel spoon into a cup of hot tea, then we will find that the temperature of spoon rises and it becomes hot"
14137,"in this case, some of the heat contained in hot tea has been transferred to spoon which is placed inside it"
14138,"when the two objects attain the same temperature, then the flow of heat stops"
14139,this means that no heat will be transferred from one object to another if the temperature of the two objects is the same
14140,there are three ways through which heat can be transferred from a hot object to a cold object
14141,"by conduction (in solid, heat is transferred by conduction) by convention (in liquid and gases, heat is transferred by convection) by radiation (in free space or vacuum, heat is transferred by radiation) let us discuss all the three ways of heat transfer"
14142,"conduction the mode of transfer of heat from hotter part of a material to its colder part or from a hot material to a cold material in contact with it, without the movement of material as a whole, is known as conduction"
14143,"in all the solids, heat is transferred by the process of conduction"
14144,conductor and insulator of heat materials which allow heat to be conducted through them easily are conductors of heat
14145,"those metals such as iron, copper, silver, aluminium, etc., are good conductors of heat"
14146,bad conductors of heat are those materials which do not allow heat to be conducted through them easily
14147,"uses of good and bad conductors of heat during the winter season, we generally wear woollen clothes"
14148,"if we compare them with cotton clothes, then we will find that the wool fibres have much more space between them"
14149,these get filled with air which is a bad conductor of heat
14150,"hence, being an insulator, both wool and air together prevent the heat from our bodies from escaping out"
14151,we cover the ice with a jute cloth of sawdust to prevent it from gaining heat from the surroundings and melting
14152,"the double walls of the refrigerators having space inside which is filled with an insulating material, prevent the heat of the surroundings from reaching the inside of the refrigerator"
14153,the two thinner blankets (one on top of the other) during the winter season are very much effective because the air layer trapped between the thinner blankets creates insulation and provides the protection from cold
14154,"sometimes, there are two things which are at the same temperature"
14155,"it seems like they are at different temperatures, one being cold and the other being warm"
14156,this happens because some things are a good conductor of heat while others are poor conductors of heat
14157,"during winter season, a metal object kept in a room feels very cold to touch but a wooden object in the same room feels warmer to touch"
14158,"so, when we touch the metal object, it conducts away heat from our hand quickly"
14159,"on the other side, the wooden object (being a poor conductor of heat) does not allow the heat of our hand to escape and hence feels warmer to touch"
14160,the water (or most liquids) and air (or gases) are bad conductors of heat
14161,convection the mode of transfer of heat from the hotter part of a fluid (liquid or gas) to its colder parts by the movement of the liquid (or gas) itself is known as convection
14162,the transfer of heat by convection can take place only in liquids and gases
14163,it is due to the reason that the particles in liquids and gases can move about freely
14164,"so, the transfer of heat by convection cannot take place in solids because the particles in the solids are fixed at a place and cannot move about freely"
14165,it is also not occurred in empty space or vacuum because there are no particles of any kind in empty space which can move and transfer heat
14166,"so, due to this reason, it cannot transfer heat by conduction but it transfers heat by the process of convection"
14167,"convection in air air is a very poor conductor of heat, air transfers heat from its hotter parts to the colder parts by the process of convection"
14168,sea and land breezes the blowing of sea breeze and land breeze in coastal areas is generally occurred due to the convection of heat in air
14169,"in coastal areas during the day time, the breeze generally flows from the sea towards the land and during the night time, blows from the land towards the sea"
14170,"due to this, the air over the land becomes hotter and lighter and rises up"
14171,"so, the air from the sea which is cooler and heavier rushes to take the place created by hot rising air"
14172,"during the night, the land loses heat faster than water and becomes cooler and the air over the sea is now warmer due to which, it rises up and the cooler air over the land rushes to take its place"
14173,"radiation the mode of transfer of heat through which heat energy from a hot body to a cold body by means of heat rays without any material medium between them is known as radiation, e.g"
14174,the sun’s heat reaches the earth by the process of radiation
14175,"the sun is very far away from the earth, and there is mainly an empty space (vacuum) between the sun and the earth even, then the heat from the sun reaches the earth"
14176,"this is due to the fact that the sun being extremely hot, emits invisible heat radiation (or infrared rays) in all directions"
14177,"these radiations travel through the vacuum between the sun and the earth at a very high speed and ultimately, reach us on the earth"
14178,"therefore, we can say that the transfer of heat from a hot object to a cold object by the process of radiation does not require any medium"
14179,"in our daily life activities, we have many situations where heat is transferred by radiation through air, e.g"
14180,"depending on the temperature of surroundings, our body too gives heat to the surroundings or receives heat from the surroundings by radiation"
14181,"if a hot utensil filled with hot milk is kept away from the flame, then it cools down by transferring its heat to the surroundings by radiation"
14182,"if we stand next to a burning fire, then we will feel the heat of the fire falling on our face"
14183,the heat is transferred from the fire to our face by the process of radiation
14184,"clothes during hot summer days, people prefer to wear white clothes or light coloured clothes because light coloured clothes absorb less heat from the sun and hence, keep us cool and comfortable in hot weather while in the cold winter days people prefer to wear dark clothes because the dark coloured clothes absorb more heat rays from the sun and keep us warm in winter season"
14185,"thus, we can say that dark coloured objects absorb heat better and also emit heat better than light coloured objects"
14186,"now, let us try to study this concept on the basis of the given activity"
14187,this air prevents the flow of heat from our body to the cold surroundings

14190,the coarse beard hair and the fine soft under-hair close to the skin
14191,"to obtain breeds of sheep that possess only fine under hair, their parents are carefully chosen"
14192,this process of selecting parents for obtaining special characters in their offspring such as soft under hair in sheep is termed as selective breeding
14193,such sheep give not only better quality of wool but the yield per sheep is also higher
14194,animals that yield wool wool commonly available in the market is sheep wool
14195,several breeds of sheep are found in different parts of our country
14196,"however, the fleece of sheep is not the only source of wool, there are other sources of wool also"
14197,other sources of wool are yak wool is common in tibet and ladakh
14198,angora wool is obtained from angora goats in hilly regions such as jammu and kashmir
14199,the underfur of kashmiri goat is soft and it is woven into fine shawls called pashmina shawls
14200,the fur (hair) on the body of camels is used as wool
14201,llama and alpaca found in south america are also yielding wool
14202,"for obtaining wool, sheep are reared and bred, their hair is cut and processed into wool"
14203,"rearing and breeding of sheep rearing of sheep means to look after the sheep by providing them feed (food), shelter and health care"
14204,the persons who look after the sheep (or rearers) are called shepherds
14205,"so, shepherds take their herds of sheep to the countryside for grazing"
14206,"apart from grazing, sheep rearers also feed them a mixture of pulses, corn, jowar, oil cakes (material left after taking out oil from seeds) and minerals"
14207,"in winter, sheep are kept indoors and fed on leaves, grain and dry fodder"
14208,"so, the breeding of sheep is done to obtain such breeds of sheep which yield good quality of wool in large quantities"
14209,these breeds of sheep have a thick coat of hair on their body and are called sheep of good breeds
14210,"once, the reared sheep have developed a thick coat of hair, the hair is shaved off for getting wool"
14211,the cut off ‘wool coat’ of a sheep (along with a thin layer of skin) is called fleece
14212,processing of fibres into wool the wool which is used for knitting sweaters or for weaving shawls is the finished product of a long process
14213,processing of fibres into wool involves the following steps: step i: the fleece of the sheep along with thin layer of skin is removed from the body
14214,the hair of the sheep are shaved off by using a saving machine similar to that used by barbers
14215,shearing does not hurt the sheep because the uppermost layer of the skin of sheep is ‘dead’
14216,the shearing (cutting the hair) of sheep is done in hot weather of summer so that sheep may survive without their protective coat of hair
14217,the hair of sheep grow again before the onset of winter and protect them in cold weather
14218,"step ii: the fleece of sheep (or cut the hair of sheep) contains dust, dirt, dried sweat and grease, etc"
14219,"so, the sheared hair of sheep is thoroughly cleaned by washing with soap (or detergent) and a lot of water in tanks"
14220,"the process of separating the fleece of a sheep into sections according to the quality of woollen fibres (such as fine, coarse, long, short, etc) is called sorting"
14221,"in sorting, the hairy skin is sent to a factory where hair of different textures is separated or sorted"
14222,every section of wool obtained after sorting contains the same quality wool
14223,"step iv: the small fluffy fibres, called burrs, are picked out from the hair (burrs are soft, fluffy fibres in wool)"
14224,the wool obtained after this is ready to be drawn into fibres)
14225,"step v: the natural fleece or hair of sheep (or goat) is white, brown or black in colour"
14226,the white woollen fibre obtained by sorting can be dyed in different colours
14227,"step vi: the fibres are straightened, combed and rolled into yarn"
14228,"the long woollen fibres are spun (or twisted) into thick yarn called wool which is used for knitting sweaters, etc"
14229,"the short woollen fibres are spun into fine yarn and then woven on a loom to make woollen clothes (like shawls, etc)"
14230,"finally, we conclude that the sheep’s hair is sheared off from the body, scoured, sorted, dyed, combed and spun to obtain wool (for knitting sweaters) and woollen yarn (for weaving cloth)"
14231,the quality of woollen cloth depends on the breed of sheep from which wool is obtained
14232,occupational hazard the wool industry is an important source of livelihood for many people in our country
14233,the people who do the job of sorting (separating) the fleece of sheep into fibres of different qualities are called sorters
14234,"the sorter’s job is very risky because sometimes, they get infected by the bacteria called anthrax which cause a deadly blood disease called sorter’s disease"
14235,the risks faced by people working in any industry due to the nature of their work are called occupational hazard
14236,silk silk is a natural fibre which is obtained from an insect (called silk moth)
14237,"before we discuss the process of obtaining silk, it is necessary to know the interesting life history of the silk moth"
14238,life history of silk moth formation of silkworm the female silk moth lays eggs on mulberry leaves
14239,the eggs are hatched into very small larvae within a week
14240,the silkworms feed on the leaves of mulberry tree and grow bigger in size
14241,"development of cocoon when the silkworm (or caterpillar) is ready to enter the next stage of its development called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold itself"
14242,"during these movement of head, the silkworm secrets fibre made of protein which hardens on exposure to air and becomes silk fibre (or silk thread)"
14243,soon the silkworm (or caterpillar) covers itself by silk fibres and turns into pupa
14244,the silkworm continues to develop in the form of pupa inside the cocoon to form the silk moth
14245,"production of silk in order to produce silk, the silkworm developing inside the cocoon (as pupa) is not allowed to mature into an adult silk moth"
14246,"so, as soon as the cocoon is formed, it is used to obtain silk fibres and the developing silkworm (as pupa) gets killed"
14247,"some of the silkworms (as pupae) are however, allowed to live and mature into silk moths so that they can lay eggs to produce more silkworms"
14248,"there is a variety of silk moths which look very different from one another and the silk yarn they yield is different in texture (coarse, smooth, shiny, etc)"
14249,"thus, tassar silk, kosa silk, mooga silk, etc are obtained from cocoons spun by different types of moths"
14250,the silk obtained from the cocoons of mulberry silk moth is called mulberry silk
14251,"mulberry silk is soft, lustrous (shiny) and elastic and can be dyed in beautiful colours"
14252,pure and artificial silk pure silk is obtained from the cocoons of silkworm and it is made up of protein
14253,artificial silk is obtained from wood pulp and it is made of modified plant material ‘cellulose’
14254,"so, a piece of woollen fabric also burns giving the smell of burning hair"
14255,the thread which burns giving a smell of burning paper will be cotton fibres
14256,"from cocoon to silk for obtaining silk, silk moths are reared and their cocoons are collected to get silk thread"
14257,rearing silkworms a female silk moth lays hundred of eggs at a time
14258,the eggs are stored carefully on strips of paper or cloth and sold to silkworm farmers
14259,they warm them to a suitable temperature for the larvae to hatch from egg
14260,the larvae are kept in clean bamboo trays along with young and freshly chopped mulberry leaves
14261,"after 25-30 days, the silkworms stop eating and start spinning the cocoons"
14262,small racks or twigs may be provided in the trays to which cocoons get attached
14263,processing silk the cocoons are collected and boiled in water to kill the insect inside them
14264,reeling the silk the process of taking out fibres from the cocoon for use as silk is known as reeling the silk
14265,silk fibres are spun into silk threads which are woven into silk cloth by weavers
14266,discovery of silk the discovery of silk was made in china a long time bach
14267,"according to an old chinese legend, the empress si-tung-chi was ashed by the emperor huang-ti to find the cause of the damaged leaves of mulberry trees growing in their garden"
14268,she also noticed that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them
14269,"accidentally, a cocoon dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads separated from the cocoon"
14270,silk industry began in china and was kept a closely guarded secret for hundreds of years
14271,india is also among the leading silk producing countries of the world
14272,"in india, a large number of women are engaged in various activities related to the silk product such as the rearing of silkworms, reeling of silk from cocoons and processing of raw silk into fabrics"

14275,"physical changes chemical changes physical changes in a physical change, a substance undergoes changes only in its physical properties such as shape, size, colour and state, and no new substance is formed"
14276,"first, we shall perform some activities to show the physical changes that are taking place all around us are: characteristics of physical changes the physical changes are temporary changes which can be easily reversed to form the original substance"
14277,"thus, we noticed that the important characteristics of physical changes are as follows: no new substance is formed in this change"
14278,a chemical change occurs when two substances react chemically to form a new substance with different chemical properties
14279,all the new substances which we use in various fields of our life are produced as a result of chemical changes (or chemical reactions)
14280,a change with which we are quite familiar is the rusting of iron
14281,almost every iron (or steel) object kept in the open gets rusted slowly
14282,it acquires a coating of a brownish substance called rust and the process is called rusting
14283,"we can usually see iron gates of parks or farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns and gardens, almost every article of iron, kept in the open gets rusted"
14284,"the agricultural tools such as spades and shovels, also get rusted when exposed to the atmosphere for some time"
14285,"in the kitchen, a wet iron pan (tawa) often gets rusted if left in that state for some time"
14286,"now, we shall perform some activities to show the chemical changes where new substances are formed"
14287,"when baking soda (nahco3) reacts with vinegar which contains acetic acid carbon dioxide comes out, which turns lime water milky, therefore it is a chemical change"
14288,"in all these activities, we saw that in each change, one or more new substances are formed"
14289,"when the magnesium ribbon was burnt, the ash was the new substance formed"
14290,"the reaction of copper sulphate with iron produced two new substances, i.e"
14291,vinegar and baking soda together produced carbon dioxide which turned lime water milky
14292,"so, all those changes in which one or more new substances formed, are called chemical changes"
14293,these are permanent changes which can usually not be reversed to form the original substance
14294,"in addition to new products, the following may accompany a chemical change: heat, light or any other radiation (e.g"
14295,a change in smell may take place or a new smell may be given off
14296,chemical changes in our daily life chemical changes are very important in our lives
14297,"indeed, every new material is discovered by studying chemical changes, e.g"
14298,"if metal is to be extracted from an ore such as iron from iron ore, we need to carry out a series of chemical changes"
14299,medicine is the end product of a chain of chemical reactions
14300,important and useful new materials such as plastics and detergents are produced by chemical reactions
14301,we saw from the activity that burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical change
14302,"burning of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical change"
14303,burning is always accompanied in the production of heat and light
14304,"an explosion of a firework (or crackers) is also a chemical change which produces heat, light, sound and unpleasant gases that pollute the atmosphere"
14305,this shows that new substances have been formed in the spoiled food which has a foul smell
14306,"if we cut an apple into slices and kept in the open for some time, we will find that the cut surface of apple acquires a brown colour"
14307,this change in colour is due to the formation of the new substance by the action of oxygen (or air)
14308,"similarly, the cut surface of potato or brinjal turns black on keeping in air for some time due to the chemical change"
14309,"when an acid reacts with a base, then a neutralisation reaction takes place in which two new substances, salt and water, are formed"
14310,"during photosynthesis, the plants intake carbon dioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight to form two new substances, glucose (food) and oxygen"
14311,"in the process of digestion, the various food materials break down to form new substances which can be absorbed by the body, so the process of digestion is a chemical change"
14312,"rusting of iron when an iron object is left exposed to moist air, it chemically reacts with oxygen and water in the air to form a red-brown flaky substance called rust"
14313,"the process of rusting can be represented by the following equation: iron (fe) + oxygen (o2) (from air) + water (h2o) → rust (iron oxide, fe2o3) rusting occurs in the presence of both oxygen and water"
14314,"the rust slowly eats away or corrodes the iron, leading to considerable loss"
14315,"since iron is used in making bridges, ships, * cars, truck bodies and many other articles, the monetary loss due to the rusting is huge"
14316,preventions of rusting rusting can be prevented by not allowing the iron to come in contact with moisture and air
14317,"the simplest method is to coat the iron with oil, grease or paint"
14318,a more efficient method is to coat the iron with another metal such as zinc or chromium
14319,the process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation
14320,the iron pipes we use in our homes to carry water are galvanised to prevent rusting
14321,rusting of ships is a major problem in the shipping industry as the body of a ship is always in contact with water and the air around it is also very humid
14322,rusting of iron can be prevented by allowing it to make stainless steel
14323,"stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese"
14324,crystallisation seawater contains salts dissolved in it which makes it salty
14325,we have learnt in class vi that salt can be obtained from seawater by the process of evaporation
14326,the salt obtained in this manner is not pure and its crystals are small
14327,"large crystals of pure substances can, however, be obtained from their solutions by the process of crystallisation"
14328,the process of cooling a hot concentrated solution of a substance to obtain crystals is called crystallisation
14329,the process of crystallisation is used to obtain crystals of a pure solid substance from the impure solid substance
14330,impure copper sulphate powder can be purified by the process of crystallisation to obtain large crystals of pure copper sulphate

14333,it opens the shell of its prey and pops out its stomach through its mouth surrounding the soft body of its prey
14334,the starfish after capturing its prey brings bach its stomach inside its own body
14335,digestion in humans the food components pass through a continuous canal and get digested in each compartment
14336,"this is called an alimentary canal, it is ‘the tract or canal running from mouth to anus of human being where digestion and absorption of food take place.’ the alimentary canal can be divided into various compartments: the buccal cavity food pipe or oesophagus stomach small intestine large intestine ending in the rectum the anus the main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices are salivary gland liver pancreas various processes involved in utilisation of food in humans are the process of taking food into the body is called ingestion"
14337,the process by which the food containing large insoluble substances is broken down into small water-soluble substances is called digestion
14338,physical method (including chewing and grinding of food in mouth) and chemical method (addition of digestive juices to the food by the body itself)
14339,the process by which the digested food passes through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream is called absorption
14340,"the process by which the absorbed food is taken in body cells and used for energy, growth and repair is called assimilation"
14341,the process by which the undigested food is removed from the body is called egestion
14342,"carbohydrates, fats and proteins are large insoluble substances which cannot pass through the walls of our intestine and get absorbed in that form"
14343,"the carbohydrates get broken down into simple sugar called glucose, while fats in fatty acid and glycerol and proteins get broken down into amino acids during digestion"
14344,these simpler compounds are easily absorbed by the walls of small intestine into the blood
14345,human digestive system the system that consists of the digestive tract along with glands is called the digestive system
14346,"now, let us know what happens to the food in different parts of the digestive tract"
14347,mouth and buccal cavity the process of ingestion starts from the mouth or buccal cavity
14348,"as we ingest, food the salivary glands present in the mouth start its digestion"
14349,the teeth present in the buccal cavity cut the food into small pieces by chewing and grinding it
14350,this saliva contains digestive enzymes which help in partial digestion of food (starch)
14351,this partially digested food is swallowed by the tongue and passed down to oesophagus or food pipe
14352,teeth the food is cut by the teeth inside the mouth
14353,each tooth is rooted in a separate socket in the gums
14354,there are four types of teeth: incisors these are four chisel-shaped incisors at centre of each jaw for biting and cutting the food
14355,"canines these are two large pointed teeth just behind incisors in each jaw, for piercing and tearing the food"
14356,"premolars these are four (two on each side) large premolars with the flat surface behind the canines in each jaw, for grinding and chewing"
14357,"molars in an adult, these are six (three on each side) large molars with the flat surface behind the premolars in each jaw, for grinding"
14358,"milk teeth and permanent teeth in human beings, teeth grow twice"
14359,"the sets of teeth that grow during infancy (when one is a small baby), are called milh teeth"
14360,these teeth get loosen and fall off at the age of 6-8 years
14361,"when milh teeth fall off, a new sets of teeth grow in their place"
14362,this second set of teeth is called permanent teeth because these remain till the old age
14363,"but if these teeth fall down, no new teeth arise on its place"
14364,"sweets and tooth decay the tooth is covered by white, hard outer covering of tooth called enamel below which dentine is present"
14365,it is similar to bone which protects the pulp cavity having nerves and blood vessels
14366,bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful to us
14367,"however, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating, many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it"
14368,these bacteria breakdown the sugars present from the leftover food and release acids
14369,"therefore, tooth decay is defined as the process of rotting of tooth and formation of cavity or holes in it which leads to the toothache"
14370,"when the holes or cavity reaches to the pulp cavity, it causes pain"
14371,if these cavities are not treated on time it causes severe toothache and may result in tooth loss
14372,one should rinse and clean its teeth thoroughly after every meal
14373,"we should clean our teeth with the help of datun or brush and toothpaste, twice a day"
14374,we should use dental floss which is a special strong thread
14375,it is moved between two teeth to take out trapped food particles
14376,"dirty fingers or unwashed objects must be avoided to put in the we should avoid the use of sweets, chocolates, toffees, ice-cream, be avoided"
14377,tongue it is a muscular organ attached at the back to the floor of the buccal cavity
14378,"it is free from the front and can help in mixing saliva with the food, swallowing the food, talking or speaking and tasting with the help of taste buds for sweet, salt, sour and bitter food"
14379,the food pipe or oesophagus it is the tube-like structure which connects the mouth to the stomach and runs along neck and chest
14380,it carries slightly digested food from the mouth to the stomach
14381,food is pushed downward by a wave like movement of the wall of foodpipe as a result of alternate contraction and relaxation
14382,the chewed food that enters the oesophagus from mouth and is passed down to stomach is called bolus
14383,"sometimes, food is not accepted by our stomach and is vomited out because the food moves in the opposite direction, i.e"
14384,our windpipe (that carries air from nostril to our lungs) and foodpipe runs adjacent to each other
14385,"when we swallow food, a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the food into the foodpipe"
14386,"but if we laugh or talk while eating, the windpipe remains open and food particle enters into the windpipe and we experience hiccups, cough or choking si characteristic ‘gulping sound’ repeatedly and coughing clears the blockage of windpipe 3"
14387,the stomach the stomach was first discovered by an american doctor william beaumont in 1822 accidentally in the man named alexis st
14388,it is a thick walled bag-like structure which is present on the left side of the abdomen
14389,its shape is like flattened u and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal
14390,the semi-digested food from oesophagus enters into stomach where further digestion takes place
14391,the churning of food into stomach takes place for three hours
14392,the food is broken down into smaller pieces and forms semi-solid paste
14393,"the inner lining of stomach secretes mucus, hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes or juices"
14394,the function of mucus is to protect the lining of stomach from the action of hydrochloric acid
14395,the secretion of hydrochloric acid makes the medium acidic inside the stomach
14396,it kills the harmful bacteria present in the food and also helps in the digestion of proteins in the stomach
14397,the partially digested food which moves from stomach to the small intestine is called chyme
14398,the small intestine it is highly coiled long tube with length of about 7.5 metres
14399,the small intestine is a narrow tube which receives secretions from the liver and pancreas
14400,the complete digestion of food takes place inside the small intestine and the food components are also absorbed here
14401,"liver is the reddish-brown coloured gland, situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side"
14402,it secretes bile juices which is stored in a sac-like structure called as gall bladder
14403,"it breaks the fat molecules into tiny droplets so that its further breakdown into simpler compounds, becomes easy"
14404,the pancreas is a large cream coloured gland which is located just below the stomach and secretes pancreatic juices
14405,"it breaks down fats into simpler compounds like fatty acid and glycerol, carbohydrate into simple sugars and proteins into simpler amino acids"
14406,the intestinal juices secreted by the walls of small intestine also help in the digestion of carbohydrate and proteins into simpler and water soluble substance
14407,this digested food is now absorbed by the walls of small intestine
14408,absorption in the small intestine the blood vessels in the walls of the intestine absorb the digested and water soluble substance to produce energy for growth and development of animals
14409,the inner walls of small intestine have thousands of finger-like outgrowths called villi
14410,these villi help in increasing the surface area of small intestine for the absorption of digested food
14411,villi possess a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface
14412,these blood vessels absorb the digested food material and transport it to the different organs of the body where these are used to build repair the body and to provides energy
14413,the glucose breaks down into carbon dioxide and water and releases huge amount of energy with the help of oxygen inside the cell
14414,fatty acid and glycerol help in building the component of cells and form fats which is stored in the body as food reserve while amino acid is used in growth and repair of the body
14415,the undigested food material is not absorbed by the small intestine and it passes from here to the large intestine
14416,the undigested semi-solid food is passed from small intestine to large intestine
14417,the large intestine absorbs water and salt from the undigested food
14418,the remaining waste material then passes to the rectum and remains there for some time in the form of semi-solid faeces
14419,this waste faecal matter is then removed through the anus from the body by the process called egestion
14420,diarrhoea it is a condition in which a person passes out watery stools frequently
14421,"it is a disease which is caused by an infection, food poisoning or indigestion"
14422,"in this condition, there is a loss of water and salts from the body of a person through frequent watery stools"
14423,this loss of water from the body of a person through watery stool is called dehydration and it may be fatal under severe conditions
14424,"in order to prevent dehydration, the person suffering from diarrhoea should be given a solution of sugar and salt in the clean water for several times in a day"
14425,the ors makes up the loss of water and salt in the body and sugar provides energy which helps in the recovery of disease
14426,the dehydration of body can be prevented during diarrhoea by giving ors solution regularly to the patients
14427,"in the mean time, the doctors should be called for medicines to cure of diarrhoea"
14428,"digestion in grass-eating animals the herbivorous animals such as cow, buffaloes, etc eat grass"
14429,these animals quickly swallow the grass and store it in a part of stomach called rumen
14430,rumen possess cellulose digesting bacteria which breakdown the food by fermentation
14431,this partially digested food or grass present in the rumen of cow is called cud
14432,this cud is brought back into the mouth of the cow from the rumen into small lumps and animal chews it again
14433,"when this cud is thoroughly chewed in the mouth of the cow, it is swallowed again"
14434,this time the chewed cud does not go back to rumen but enter into the other compartments of cow’s stomach and then into the small intestine for complete digestion and absorption of food
14435,"the cellulose digesting bacteria are not present in the body of human being, therefore human beings and other carnivore cannot digest cellulose present in plant food items"
14436,"feeding and digestion in amoeba amoeba is a microscopic single-celled organism, which is found in pond water"
14437,it is a very simple animal and cannot be seen by naked eyes
14438,"amoeba has a cell membrane, a rounded dense nucleus and many small bubble-like vacuoles in its cytoplasm"
14439,food vacuole contains food surrounded by water while contractile vacuole contains liquid or water and controls water regulation activity in amoeba
14440,"the body of amoeba has finger-like projections, called pseudopodia or false feet"
14441,the food of amoeba are microscopic organisms like tiny plants and animals present in pond water
14442,"when amoeba senses its food, it pushes out pseudopodia around the food particle and engulfs it"
14443,"the two pseudopodia join around the food particle and trap the food particle with a little water forming vacuole around food, thus the food gets trapped"
14444,"digestive juices present inside the vacuole, acts on the food and break it into simpler substances"
14445,"this digested food is then absorbed and is used for growth, maintenance and multiplication of amoeba"
14446,the basic process of digestion of food and release of energy is as similar to the other organisms

14449,a shining steel spoon represents both a convex mirror as well as a concave mirror
14450,"as the front side (or inner side) of a spoon is bent inward, so the front side of a shining spoon represents a concave mirror while the back side (or outer side) of a spoon is bulging outward, so the back side of a shining spoon represents a convex mirror as shown in figure"
14451,concave mirror (converging mirror) the mirror whose reflecting surface is concave (and polished surface is convex) is called a concave mirror
14452,"the concave mirror reflects the parallel rays of light in such a way that after reflection, all the rays converge (or meet) at one point called focus in front of the mirror"
14453,since a concave mirror converges a beam of parallel light rays
14454,"therefore, a concave mirror is also known as a converging mirror"
14455,image formed by a concave mirror when the object is far off a concave mirror forms a real image of the sun
14456,we can understand the formation of the image by a concave mirror when the object is far off by an activity
14457,"therefore, we can conclude that the image formed by a concave mirror is much smaller than the object (highly diminished) and real because it can be obtained on a sheet of paper (which is a kind of screen)"
14458,"so, when an object is placed at a far off distance front a concave mirror, then image formed by a concave mirror is real inverted much smaller than the object"
14459,image formed by a concave mirror when the object is placed close to concave mirror let us perform an activity to understand the formation of image by a concave mirror when the object is placed close to the concave mirror
14460,"since the image can be observed only by looking into the concave mirror and cannot be formed on the screen, therefore, the image is virtual"
14461,"if we look at the image in the concave mirror, we find it to be the same side up as the candle, so the image is erect"
14462,"and if we compare the size of the candle and its image, then we will find that the image is larger than the candle"
14463,"therefore, the image is larger than the object (enlarged or magnified)"
14464,"hence, we can conclude that when an object is placed close to a concave mirror, the image formed by the concave mirror is virtual erect larger than the object (enlarged or magnified)"
14465,"uses of concave mirrors to see the large image of teeth of a patient, concave mirrors are used by the dentist"
14466,"in torches, headlights of vehicles and searchlights to get a strong, straight beam of light, etc., concave mirrors are used as reflectors"
14467,"to see a large image of the face, then concave mirrors are used as shaving mirrors"
14468,convex mirror (diverging mirror) the mirror whose reflecting surface is bulging or convex (polished surface is concave) is called the convex mirror
14469,"after reflection from the convex mirror, the parallel rays of light are spreading out"
14470,"when the parallel rays of light spread out, we can say that the rays of light are diverging"
14471,"now, we can say that a beam of parallel light rays diverges (spreads out) after reflection from a convex mirror"
14472,"since a convex mirror diverges a beam of parallel light rays, therefore, it is also known as a diverging mirror"
14473,image formed by a convex mirror let us perform an activity to understand the formation of an image by a convex mirror
14474,the image of the candle can be seen only by looking into the convex mirror and cannot be formed on a screen
14475,"if we look at the image in the convex mirror, we will find that it is the same side up as the candle"
14476,"and if we compare the size of the candle and its image, the image appears to be smaller"
14477,"therefore, the image is smaller in size than the object (or diminished)"
14478,"even if we change the distance of candle (object) from the convex mirror, we will notice that in every case, the image of the candle formed by the convex mirror remains virtual, erect and smaller in size than the candle"
14479,"so, we can conclude that whatever be the distance of the object from a convex mirror, the image formed by a convex mirror is always virtual erect and smaller than the object (or diminished)"
14480,"uses of convex mirrors to see the traffic at the rear side or backside on the road, convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors or side view mirrors in vehicles such as cars, scooters, buses, etc"
14481,"by installing a convex mirror in the shop, the shop owner can keep an eye on the customers"
14482,image formed by lenses since a lens is a piece of transparent glass bound by the two spherical surfaces
14483,"lenses are of two types: convex lens concave lens get some lens and try to touch them, we will find that some are thicker in the middle than at the edges and some are thinner in the middle than at the edge"
14484,convex lens (converging lens) the convex lens is the lens which is thicker in the middle than at the edges
14485,a beam of parallel rays of light falls on a convex lens from the left side
14486,"after passing through the convex lens, the beam of parallel rays of light converges at a point as shown in the figure given below"
14487,image formed by a convex lens the nature and size of the image formed by a convex lens depend on the distance of the object from the convex lens
14488,"thus, we can conclude that when an object is placed at a far off distance from a convex lens, then the image formed by the convex lens is real, inverted and much smaller than the object (or highly diminished)"
14489,"now, change the distance of the candle from the lens and try to obtain the image of the candle flame every time on the screen by moving it"
14490,"so, is it possible to get in any position of the object for which image was erect and, magnified"
14491,"yes, it is possible when the candle is placed very close to the convex lens"
14492,uses of convex lenses convex lenses are used as a magnifying glass
14493,"in the manufacturing of spectacles, camera, microscope, telescope and binoculars, convex lenses are used"
14494,concave lens (diverging lens) a concave lens is a lens which is thinner in the middle than at the edge
14495,a parallel beam of light falls on a concave lens as shown in the figure
14496,"after passing through the concave lens, the rays of light are diverging (or spreading out)"
14497,"since a concave lens diverges light rays falling on it, therefore, it is also called a diverging lens"
14498,"image formed by a concave lens in the case of a convex lens, we have studied that the nature of image formed depends on the distance of the object from the convex lens"
14499,"but, this is not followed in the case of a concave lens"
14500,let us perform an activity to understand the formation of an image by a concave lens
14501,"uses of concave lenses in order to see the image of the person standing outside, concave lenses are used in the peepholes in the door of hotel rooms"
14502,sunlight: white or coloured we might have noticed a rainbow which usually appears after the rain when the sun is low in the sky
14503,an arc of seven colours seen in the sky is known as the rainbow
14504,"the seven colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet"
14505,"we might also have seen that when we blow soap bubbles, they appear colourful"
14506,"similarly, when light is reflecting from the surface of a compact disc (cd), we can see many colours"
14507,the rainbow is produced by the dispersion of sunlight by tiny raindrops suspended in the atmosphere
14508,"dispersion of light in the year 1665, newton discovered by his experiments with glass prisms that white light (like sunlight) consists of a mixture of lights of seven colours"
14509,"newton found that if a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism, then the white light splits to form a band of seven colours on a white screen"
14510,"the band of seven colours formed on a white screen, when a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism, is known as a spectrum of white light"
14511,"the seven colours of the spectrum are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet"
14512,"so, dispersion of light is the phenomenon of splitting up of white light into seven colours on passing through a transparent medium like a glass prism"
14513,the formation of a spectrum of seven colours indicates that white light is a mixture of seven colours
14514,"so, now we can say that sunlight consists of seven colours"
14515,"this can be done by using newton’s disc, let us try this"
14516,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 15 light pdf free download will help you

14518,asexual reproduction sexual reproduction the term ‘sexual’ means involving the fusion of sex cells or gametes while ‘asexual’ means without involving the fusion of gametes
14519,asexual reproduction the process in which only one parent is involved in the production of new individuals of the same kind is called asexual reproduction
14520,"in plants, asexual reproduction results in the formation of offsprings or new plants without seeds or spores"
14521,asexual reproduction in plants occurs through the following methods: vegetative propagation budding fragmentation spore formation 1
14522,"vegetative propagation it is the formation of new plants from vegetative units of bud, stem, etc"
14523,vegetative reproduction may take place using various plant parts as given below: (i) vegetative reproduction by stem the stems or branches of the plant normally bear buds in the axils
14524,the point of attachment of leaf at the node) develops into the shoot
14525,these buds consist of a short stem around which immature overlapping leaves are folded
14526,methods to vegetative reproduction by stem (i) new plants are obtained from the stem by the cutting method
14527,"in this method, the small part of stem is removed by making a cut with a sharp knife"
14528,now the lower end of stem cutting is buried in the moist soil
14529,"the upper part of cutting having bud on it, is kept above the soil"
14530,"thus, a new plant is produced which is exactly similar to the parent plant, e.g"
14531,(ii) another method of vegetative reproduction in stem is by layering
14532,"in this method, a mature branch of parent plant is bent down and covered with soil"
14533,the root develops from the branches and grows into a new plant
14534,"layering method is usually done in the plants that have long and slender branches, e.g"
14535,"(iii) grafting is also a method of vegetative reproduction in stems, where new plants of desired qualities is developed from two different plants"
14536,the part that has shoot part is called scion and part having root is called stock
14537,"scion is attached to the stock which provides support and basic requirement for the development of plant, e.g"
14538,"(ii) vegetative reproduction by leaves when the leaf of some plants are hurried into the moist soil, the cut edges or margins of leaves develop a new plants that resemble to the parent, e.g"
14539,"(iii) vegetative reproduction by roots and bulbs in some plants like sweet potato, dahlia, etc, a new plant develops through their roots and bulbs"
14540,note: plants like cacti produces new plants when their parts get detached from the main plant body
14541,advantages of vegetative propagation plants produced with vegetative reproduction takes less time to grow and bear flower and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds
14542,the new plants are the exact copies of parent plant because they are produced from a single parent
14543,"budding in this process, a daughter individual is formed from a small projection on parent body called a bud"
14544,"yeast grow and multiply in every few hours, if provided with sufficient nutrients and favourable condition"
14545,fragmentation some algae (spirogyra) that are present in waterbodies reproduce by fragmentation
14546,"in this- method, the body of the parent breaks into small pieces called fragments and each fragment grows up to become a new plant"
14547,"if water and nutrient are available, the algae will grow and multiply rapidly by fragmentation"
14548,"if this process continues, it will cover a large area in a very short period of time"
14549,spore formation some fungus like bread mould reproduces asexually by spore formation
14550,"spores (present in the air) are the small spherical bodies, having a thick protective wall that protects them from unfavourable conditions"
14551,when favourable conditions arrive the spores burst and germinate to develop into new plants
14552,spores are very light asexually reproducing bodies which can be carried over a long distance by air or wind
14553,some other plants like mosses and ferns also reproduce by spore formation in the underside of their leaves
14554,they help the plants in sexual reproduction and producing fruits and seeds
14555,"in sexual reproduction, a male cell is produced by the male part of a flower which fuses with a female cell produced by the female part of the flower"
14556,"these cells are called gametes, which when combined form a zygote by the process called fertilisation"
14557,parts of a flower the main parts of a flower are (i) sepals these are the green leaf-like outermost circle of the flower
14558,the function of the calyx is to protect the flower when it is in bud form
14559,(ii) petals these are the colourful and most attractive part of the flower
14560,(iii) stamen it is a male reproductive organ of a plant
14561,these are the little stalks with swollen top and lies inside the ring of petals
14562,the stalk of stamen is called filament and the swollen top of stamen is called anther
14563,the anther contains the pollen grain which have male gamete in it
14564,these appear as the yellow powder like substance which is sticky in nature
14565,(iv) pistil it is the female reproductive part of a flower that lies in the centre of a flower
14566,"these are a flask-shaped structure which is made up of three parts, i.e"
14567,the middle part of the pistil is tube-like structure called style which connects stigma to the ovary
14568,the swollen bottom part at the base of pistil is called ovary
14569,these ovules contain the female sex cells also called an egg cell
14570,the base of the flower on which all the parts of the flower are attached is called receptacle
14571,"types of flower on the basis of the type of reproductive organs present in a flower, the flowers are of following types: (i) unisexual flower: the flower which contains only one reproductive organ (i.e"
14572,(ii) bisexual flower: the flower that contains both reproductive parts (i.e
14573,male and female) in a single flower are called a bisexual flower
14574,function of a flower the function of a flower is to make male and female gametes and also to ensure that fertilisation would take place for the seed formation
14575,during sexual reproduction male and female gametes fuse to form the zygote
14576,pollination the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a pistil is called pollination
14577,"pollination takes place in two different ways: (i) self-pollination: when the pollen grain from the anther of one flower reaches to the stigma of the same ‘ flower, it is called self-pollination"
14578,(ii) cross-pollination: when the pollen grains from the anther of a flower or of a plant are transferred to the stigma of a flower of the same plant or that of a different plant of the same kind the process is called cross-pollination
14579,"this transfer to another plant is mediated by insects, wind, water, animals, birds, etc"
14580,"agents of pollination the process of pollination is carried out by some external agencies like wind, water, insects, birds, etc"
14581,fertilisation the process in which the male gamete fuses with the female gamete to form a new cell (called zygote) is called fertilisation
14582,"when the pollens are deposited on the stigma of the pistol, it begins to germinate"
14583,"after some time, a long pollen tube is developed from the pollen grain which passes through the style towards the female gametes in the ovary"
14584,the male gametes move down the pollen tube and the tube enters the ovule present inside the ovary
14585,the tip of pollen tube bursts and the male gamete comes out of the pollen tube
14586,"inside the ovary, the male gametes fuse with the female gametes present in the ovule to form a fertilised egg cell which is called zygote"
14587,the zygote develops into an embryo which is a part of a seed that develops into a new plant
14588,"fruit and seed formation after the fertilisation, the ovary grows into the fruit and the ovule develops into the seeds"
14589,stigma and style also fall off leaving ovary on the receptacle
14590,the zygote inside the ovary gets its food from the ovule and grows by cell division to form an embryo
14591,parts of the ovule develop into the seed covering or seed coat
14592,"mango, apple and orange, while some are hard like almonds and walnuts"
14593,"if a large number of seeds falls on the same place, they will not get enough space for water and light, and will not develop into a healthy plant"
14594,"thus, the seeds are moved away by some external agencies to far off places"
14595,the process by which the seeds are scattered to different places (far and wide from their parents) is called dispersal
14596,"the seeds and fruits are dispersed away through various agencies like wind, water, birds and some animals"
14597,sometime seed dispersal takes place naturally by the explosion or bursting of fruits
14598,"seed dispersing agents wind, water, animals, birds and humans are the dispersing agents of seeds"
14599,"these are described below: dispersal by wind or air the seeds that are very light and have wing or hair-like structure on them, are easily carried away by the blowing wind, e.g"
14600,"seeds of maple, drumstick have wings, seeds of madar or oak have hairs on them, cottonseed also possess hairs on them, while seeds of grasses, orchids, begonia are very small and light"
14601,these seeds can be easily carried away by the wind and dispersed away from their natural habitat
14602,dispersal by water the seeds of some plants that have an outer fibrous or spongy covering are dispersed through water
14603,"they have the ability to float in the water and drift along with its flow, e.g"
14604,"seeds of water lily, lotus, chestnut (singhara) and coconut are dispersed through water"
14605,the coconut fruits have a fibrous outer coat which enables them to float in water and carried away by flowing water to far off places
14606,dispersal by birds the birds eat fruits along with the seeds
14607,the seeds are dispersed to some other place through the bird’s faeces
14608,"the digestive enzymes present in the digestive system of birds helps in dissolving the hard seed coat and when they are released or excreted along with the faeces, they germinate, e.g"
14609,dispersal by animals some seeds have hooks or spines which get attached to the fur or body of the grazing animals
14610,"when these animals move to a distant place, the seeds get dispersed (while animal rub their body surface), e.g"
14611,fruit of xantbium and urena plants are covered by numerous hooks which attach to the animal’s fur and are dispersed with them
14612,dispersal by explosion or bursting of fruits sometimes fruits mature and a strain is produced in their walls
14613,"this produces a sudden jerk causing fruits to break open, thus allowing the seeds to scatter far away from their parent plants"
14614,"due to the explosion of fruit, the seeds are thrown away from the plant with a great force in all direction, e.g"
14615,castor plant burst suddenly with a jerk and scatter the seeds far away from the parent plant
14616,"similarly, fruit of balsam is also dispersed through the explosion mechanism"
14617,benefits of seed dispersals seed dispersal avoids overcrowding of young plants around their parent plants
14618,"it helps in preventing competition between the plants and its own seedlings for sunlight, water and minerals"
14619,one of the benefits of seed dispersal is that it enables the plant to grow into new habitats for wider distribution and provides them with a better chance of survival
14620,germination of seed a seed contains a plant embryo in a resting state which begin to grow only under favourable conditions
14621,the process by which seeds begin to grow is called seed germination
14622,"when the seed germinates, the seed coat splits and a tiny root called radicle grows downward and shoot called plumule starts growing upwards"
14623,"when the plant starts maturing, it bears flower which again produces seed and fruits"
14624,this cycle continues to produce more offsprings for the preservation of a species
14625,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 12 reproduction in plants pdf free download will help you
14626,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 12 reproduction in plants, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
14627,end products of anaerobic respiration are alcohol and co2 or lactic acid (in muscles)
14628,"breathing it is the process in which air rich in oxygen is taken inside and air rich in co2 is given out, with the help of respiratory organs"
14629,inhalation: taking in of air rich in oxygen into our body is called inhalation
14630,exhalation: giving out air rich in carbon dioxide from our body to the external environment is called exhalation
14631,this activity must be performed under the supervision of your teacher or parent
14632,close your nostrils and mouth tightly and look at a watch
14633,note down the time for which you could hold your breath
14634,we will soon start feeling uneasy and cannot hold our breath for even one minute
14635,breathing rate the number of times a person breathes in a minute is termed as breathing rate
14636,an adult human being can inhale and exhale 15-18 times in a minute
14637,it is the average breathing rate of an adult human being
14638,"breathing rate is somewhat faster in women than in men and in children, it is higher (20-30 times/min) than adults"
14639,"breathing rate is slowest while sleeping (as less energy is required) while maximum during heavy exercise like running, weight lifting, etc"
14640,"increased breathing rate provides a greater amount of air entry into the lungs, hence blood can absorb oxygen at a faster rate"
14641,"faster breathing supplies more oxygen to the body cell for producing more energy, required for heavy exercises"
14642,"during heavy exercise, the breathing rate can increase to 25 times per minute"
14643,"because of this, food gets broken down at a faster rate and thus make us feel hungry"
14644,"open our mouth wide to take a long and deep breath, of air), because our breathing rate slows down and the body does not receive sufficient oxygen"
14645,"mechanism of breathing the mechanism of breathing can be understood by the following points: normally, we take in air through our nostrils"
14646,"when we inhale air, it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity"
14647,"from the nasal cavity, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe"
14648,"a large, muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the floor of the chest cavity"
14649,"smoking lungs are very delicate organs and essential for breathing, thus beeping us alive"
14650,"smoking tobacco in the form of beedi, cigarette or cigar damages our lungs gradually and causes ill health"
14651,"while smoking, smoke along with chemicals present in tobacco enters our body"
14652,"these chemicals present in tobacco damages the lungs in many ways like breathing becomes difficult causes lung cancer, heart diseases, etc"
14653,smoking also affects people around smokers as they also inhale air containing tobacco
14654,the mechanism of breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and ribcage
14655,"the complete process of breathing can be discussed as follows: breathing in or inhalation when we breath air in (or inhale) two processes occur together, i.e"
14656,"the muscles between the ribs contract causing the ribcage to move upward and outward, while the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards"
14657,this upward and downward movement of ribcage and diaphragm respectively increases the space in the chest cavity and makes it larger
14658,"as the chest cavity becomes larger, it sucks air from outside the lungs and lungs get filled up with air and expand"
14659,"breathing out or exhalation when we breath air out or exhale the reverse process takes place, i.e"
14660,"the muscles of the ribs release causing the ribcage to move downward and inward, while diaphragm releases and moves upward"
14661,this downward movement of the rib cage and upward movement of diaphragm decreases the space in our chest cavity and makes it smaller
14662,"when the chest cavity becomes smaller, the air is pushed out of the lungs"
14663,"sneezing the air we inhale contains various types of unwanted particles like smoke, dust, pollen, etc"
14664,"during inhalation, these particles get trapped in the hair present in our nasal cavity"
14665,"they cause irritation in the lining of the nasal cavity, as a result of which we sneeze"
14666,"sneezing expels the foreign particles from the inhaled air so that dust-free, clean air may enter into the lungs"
14667,we should take care while sneezing in that we must cover our nose so that foreign particles expelled during sneezing may not be inhaled by another person nearby us
14668,"exhaled air contains carbon dioxide the air is a mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, etc"
14669,the difference between inhaled air and exhaled air is that the inhaled air contains more oxygen while exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide
14670,"besides oxygen and carbon dioxide, the air also contains more water vapour"
14671,the air which we inhale and exhale is a mixture of gases and water vapours
14672,the inhaled air is rich in oxygen while exhaled air is rich in carbon dioxide
14673,"animals such as elephants, lions, cows, goats, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds have lungs in their chest cavities like humans for respiration"
14674,"the smaller animals like cockroaches, earthworms, fishes, ants and mosquitoes do not have lungs"
14675,"cockroach insects like the cockroach, grasshopper, etc., have tiny holes on the sides of their body"
14676,"the spiracles on the body of insects are connected to a network of thin air tubes called tracheae which; spreads into the whole body of the insect, where the exchange of gases takes place"
14677,"air rich in oxygen rushes through spiracles into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the body tissue and reaches every cell of body"
14678,"similarly, co2 from the cells enters into tracheal tubes and moves out through spiracles"
14679,the blood in these animals do not contain haemoglobin and is not red in colour
14680,they cannot carry oxygen to all the parts of the body
14681,"therefore, transport of air takes place through the spiracles in these organisms"
14682,"the tracheal system or spiracles are only seen in insects, not in any other group of animals"
14683,earthworm earthworms and leeches absorb the atmospheric oxygen through their moist and slimy skin because gases can easily pass through the moist and slimy skin
14684,they absorb the atmospheric oxygen through their moist skin and transport it through the blood to all the cells
14685,"frog a frog-like human possesses a pair of lungs but when they are in the water, they breathe through their moist and slippery skin"
14686,when they are on land they breathe through their nostrils and a pair of lungs
14687,breathing under water there are many organisms which live in water
14688,some of them given below: fish fishes are the aquatic animals that live in water
14689,gills are actually the projections of skin and have blood vessels for the exchange of respiratory gases
14690,the fishes breathe by taking in water through its mouth and sending it over the gills
14691,the oxygen dissolved in the water is extracted by the gills and the extracted oxygen is absorbed by the blood
14692,this oxygen is then carried to all the parts of fishes for respiration
14693,the carbon dioxide produced during respiration is brought back by the blood into the gills and expelled into the surrounding water
14694,"dolphins and whales sea animals like dolphins and whales live in water but unlike fishes, they do not possess gills for respiration"
14695,their blowholes are located on the upper parts of their heads
14696,"dolphins and whales come to the surface of sea-water from time to time to breathe in air, sometimes whales release a function of water that moves upwards like a spray"
14697,"this is because when a whale breathes air out of its blowhole it appears as a spray or mist, also called a spot"
14698,blowholes are surrounded by muscles that keep the holes closed when the whales or dolphins are underwater and open it when the animal is at the surface and needs to breathe
14699,the human cannot survive underwater because they do not possess any gills to make use of oxygen dissolved in water for breathing
14700,when we go underwater we have to take oxygen gas cylinders for breathing
14701,respiration in plants all the organism in the world respires whether it is an animal or a plant
14702,plants also take in oxygen from the air and give out carbon dioxide
14703,they also breakdown glucose into c02 and water and releases energy to perform other functions
14704,"the respiration in plants differs from the animal because in plants, respiration occurs through leaves and roots, etc"
14705,"each plant part can independently take in oxygen from the air, utilise it to obtain energy and give out co2"
14706,respiration in leaves the leaves of the plants have tiny pores on their surface which are called stomata
14707,o2 and co2 in the leaves takes place through stomata during respiration
14708,the oxygen from air enters into a leaf through stomata and reaches inside all the cells of the leaf through diffusion while co2 produced during respiration also diffuses from the leaf to the atmosphere through the stomata
14709,respiration in roots root cells of the plants respire under the ground
14710,they also need oxygen to carry out respiration and releases energy for their own use
14711,root cells get oxygen from the air present in the spaces between the soil particles
14712,plant roots have a large number of tiny hairs on them which are called root hairs
14713,oxygen from the air present in soil particles diffuses into root hair and reaches to the cells of the root where it is utilised for respiration
14714,"note: if a potted plant is over watered for a long time, the plants die"
14715,this is because the water molecules fill the space between soil particles and push the air out
14716,"due to this reason, the oxygen is not available to the roots for aerobic respiration and plants die"
14717,due to the production of alcoholic products as a result of undergoing anaerobic respiration
14718,"it is not wise to sleep under a tree during the night because in the night, plants do not photosynthesis and plants are unable to use co2"
14719,"so, a person will suffer from suffocation and feel the excess weight on the chest"
14720,"exchange of gases the exchange of gases takes place in the plants all the time, but it is increased during day time"
14721,the leaves are more actively involved in photosynthesis during the day time in the presence of sunlight
14722,the co2 released during respiration is utilised by the plant during photosynthesis to produce its food
14723,"during photosynthesis, the o2 is released by plants which are taken up during respiration in plants"
14724,"therefore, a balance between co2 and o2 is maintained by the plants"
14725,respiration thus provides continuous energy to plants to perform all its functions regardless of time
14726,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 10 respiration in organisms pdf free download will help you
14727,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 10 respiration in organisms, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
14728,(i) top layer it constitutes the gaint and tall trees followed by shrubs and tall grasses
14729,(ii) shrub layer it has many shrubs and bushes of approximately 1-2 metres of height from the forest floor
14730,it makes dense layer at some places of forest where enough sunlight is present
14731,(iii) herb layer just below the shrub layer occurs the herb layer of plants
14732,it is the lowest layer of vegetation in the forest (having leafy plants)
14733,"(iv) forest floor plants found here are as small as mosses, liverworts, lichens"
14734,"most of the forest floor is covered with dead and decaying plant matter, and animal waste"
14735,"components of the forest the living organisms found in the forest are plants, animals, decomposers and scavengers"
14736,"the non-living environment of the forest provides nutrients, water and carbon dioxide for the growth of the plants"
14737,"plants green plants are living organisms also called autotrophs as they produce food by photosynthesis (by absorbing nutrients water from soil, co2 from air and sunlight as energy source)"
14738,they provide food to all living organisms which live in the forest
14739,animals forests have many animals and they are called consumers (of food)
14740,the animals which eat only plants/their parts are called herbivores (herb eating) whereas flesh-eating animals are called carnivores
14741,all animals are called heterotrophs because they depend on other organisms for food
14742,they feed on dead plants and animals and thus are called saprotrophs
14743,these organisms are also called decomposers as they breakdown dead parts of plants and dead bodies of animals into simple substances
14744,"scavengers those animals which eat dead animals are called scavengers, e.g"
14745,"vultures, crows, jackals, hyena, some insects (ants, beetles, termites, woodlice, maggots, millipedes and earthworms), etc"
14746,but these are not decomposers as they do not breakdown complex dead organic matter into simple ones
14747,importance of forests the forests provide us with a large number of products
14748,they also purify air and water quality and maintain soil moisture and climate
14749,forests provide many useful products the various things which are obtained from the forests are called forest products
14750,"some of the important products which we get from the forests are wood, honey, gum, sealing wax (or lac), catechu (kattha), fruits, oils, spices, natural rubber, cork, dyes, medicinal plants and fodder for cattle"
14751,perhaps the most important product obtained from forests is the wood (which is obtained by cutting down the forest trees)
14752,the wood obtained from forests is used for a large number of purposes in our day-to-day life
14753,forests maintain balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide plants in the forest release oxygen during photosynthesis
14754,this provides all animals including us with oxygen to breathe and helps to maintain the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
14755,"if the amount of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, it would result in an increase in earth’s temperature"
14756,plants in the forest intake carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis
14757,"hence, they help to maintain the right amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere"
14758,forests maintain water cycle the forest trees suck water from the soil through their roots and release water vapour into the air through transpiration
14759,this water vapour helps in the formation of clouds and bring rain on the earth
14760,"in fact, about half the rain which falls in forest areas comes from the transpiration of forest trees themselves"
14761,"in this way, forests help in maintaining a perfect water cycle in nature and meet our freshwater requirements"
14762,forests prevent occurrence of flood the forest acts as a natural absorber of rainwater and allows it to seep
14763,forests not only help in controlling floods but also help to maintain the flow of water in the streams so that we get a steady supply of water
14764,"on the other hand, if trees are not present, rain hits the ground directly and may flood the area around it"
14765,"roots of trees normally bind the soil together, but in their absence, the soil is washed away or eroded"
14766,the different kinds of plants grow together in the forest making different levels of layers and habitat for wild animals
14767,"in the absence of plants/trees, the soil will not hold water which will cause flood and erosion"
14768,"forests provide habitat for wildlife the different types of vegetation present in a forest provide food and shelter to animals, birds and insects which live in the forest"
14769,food chain food chain can be defined as a sequence of living organisms in which one organism feeds on another
14770,a typical chain in grassland is: grass → deer → lion a typical food chain in a pond is: algae → small fish → large fish flow of energy in a food chain the sun is the ultimate source of energy for everything on the planet
14771,green plants or producers are able to harness the energy of the sun to make food
14772,"in a food flow ener0y in food chain chain, energy from plants (producers) is passed on from one organism to another"
14773,"from the producers, the energy goes to primary consumers (herbivores) and is then passed on to secondary consumers (carnivores)"
14774,"thus, producers are always at the beginning of the food chain"
14775,"dynamic living entity by harbouring greater variety of plants, the forest provides great opportunities of food and habitat for the herbivores"
14776,larger number of herbivores means increased availability of food for a variety of carnivores
14777,the wide variety of animals helps the forest to regenerate and grow
14778,decomposers help in maintaining the supply of nutrients to the growing plants in the forest
14779,"there is a continuous interaction between soil, water, air, plants and animals in a forest"
14780,"forests can regenerate on their own the dead parts of trees and plants, dead animals and animal wastes (like animal dung or droppings) keep on collecting on the forest floor"
14781,decomposers (fungi and bacteria) degrade them into simple organic substances which are usable by plants in the form of humus
14782,the hummus makes the forest soil fertile by providing the nutrients
14783,"the animals, birds of forests, wind and water disperse the seeds of trees and plants on the forest soil"
14784,these seeds obtain nutrients from the soil and germinate to form seedlings and ultimately grow to form the forest vegetation
14785,forest conservation paper is made from wood pulp that is produced from the wood of forest trees
14786,"so, to make paper, many trees have to be cut down from the forests"
14787,"if all of us keep on collecting old newspapers, magazines, books, notebooks, etc., and send them to paper mills for recycling through a junk dealer (kabaddi wala), we will be able to save many forest trees from being cut down"
14788,some of the other ways to conserve forests are also given below: excessive cutting down of forest trees should not be allowed by the government to conserve forests
14789,more trees should be planted in the forest in place of cut down trees to conserve forests
14790,"paper products such as old newspapers, magazines, books, notebooks, etc., should be recycled to conserve forests"
14791,a large number of forest trees are being cut down every day to meet the various demands of the increasing population
14792,"following are the consequence if forests disappear: increase of the earth’s temperature if there are no trees and plants, their will be no photosynthesis"
14793,"this will increase the level of c02, resulting in the increase of earth’s temperature"
14794,"no food and shelter to wildlife in the absence of trees, plants and animals will not get food and shelter"
14795,"so, this will disrupt the whole cycle of life and gradually life might disappear from the land area of the earth"
14796,there will be more floods the trees plant roots help in holding the soil during rains and also soil is able to hold water
14797,"in the absence of trees, the soil will not hold water which will cause floods"
14798,deforestation endanger the environment the continuous deforestation is threatening the different form of life including human beings
14799,"so, there is necessity to think and set to conserve forests"
14800,"natural calamities like floods, cyclones, hail forms are more in the absence of trees and forest"
14801,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 17 forests: our lifeline pdf free download will help you
14802,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 17 forests: our lifeline, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
14803,circuit diagram a circuit diagram tells us how the various components in an electric circuit have been connected by using the electrical symbols of the components
14804,"(i) when the bulb glows in an electric circuit when the switch is closed, then the switch is said to be in the on position"
14805,"and when the switch in a circuit is open, then the switch is said to be in the off position"
14806,"so, in an electric circuit, a bulb lights up only when the switch is in the on position and at that time, we can say that the electric circuit is complete because the current flows throughout the circuit instantly (as shown in the figure) electric circuit (ii) when the bulb does not glow while checking the circuit notice that sometimes the bulb does not glow even when the switch is in the on position"
14807,"this condition can occur only if the bulb gets fused, i.e"
14808,"it is a difficult and time-consuming job to draw the electric circuit by making the actual drawings of cell, battery, switch, bulb, etc"
14809,"so, the scientists have devised a very easy way to represent the component of an electric circuit (cell, battery, switch, bulb, etc.) with the help of symbols, which are easy to draw"
14810,"some of the commonly used symbols for electric components are shown here: electric cell and battery the common source of electricity to run the number of devices, e.g"
14811,"torches, radio, electric clocks and watches, toys, etc., is an electric cell, but sometimes a single cell is not sufficient to run many devices as they require high voltage to run all these appliances"
14812,"the cell provides much less electricity as compared to that provided by the electric supply line, e.g"
14813,"in the case, a single electric cell which provides only 1.5 v of electricity, whereas electricity from the power station is supplied to our home at very high voltage of 220 v"
14814,combination of electric cells since the higher voltage can be obtained by combining a number of cells in series
14815,"so, when the positive terminal of one cell is joined with the negative terminal of the other cell, then the cells are said to be joined in series (as shown in figure given below)"
14816,"so, a battery can be defined as the group of cells joined together in the series, e.g"
14817,"in a torch, the cells are placed one after the other"
14818,"but in many devices, cells are not placed one after the other, e.g"
14819,"in a tv remote control, the two cells are placed side by side (or parallel to each other) instead of single one"
14820,"so, two or more cells connected in side by side manner are said to be joined in parallel"
14821,"if we combine two cells by keeping the positive terminal of one cell in contact with the positive terminal of the other cell or negative terminal of one cell in contact with the negative terminal of the other cell, then the battery obtained will not work"
14822,"the batteries which are used in cars, buses, trucks, inverters, etc., are also made of cells"
14823,there is a special feature of car battery is that its cells can be recharged
14824,connection of cells/battery ‘+’ and ‘-‘ symbols are printed in the battery in order to have an exact placement of the cells in their respective battery compartment
14825,the switch or key can be placed anywhere in the circuit
14826,the circuit is complete and it is said to be closed only when the switch is on
14827,"the circuit is incomplete and it is said to be open, only when the switch is off"
14828,"there is a thin wire in the bulb, called filament which glows when an electric current passes through it"
14829,"so, if the bulb gets fused, then its filament gets broken"
14830,note: never touch a lighted electric bulb connected to the mains as it may be very hot and can damage your hands
14831,heating effect of electric current production of heat in an electric device due to the flow of electric current is called the heating effect of electric current
14832,"we have seen an electric heater used for cooking, an electric bulb or room heater"
14833,"so, when these appliances are switched on after connecting to the electric supply, then their elements become red hot and release the heat"
14834,the degree to which a material opposes the passage of current through itself is known as its resistance
14835,"actually, when an electric current passes through a high resistance wire, the electric energy gets converted into heat energy and this heat energy heats up the wire"
14836,element all electrical heating devices consist of a coil of wire called an element
14837,"when these appliances are switched on after connecting to the electric supply, then their elements become red hot and release the heat"
14838,"there are some electric appliances such as immersion heaters, hotplates, irons, geysers, electric kettles, hair dryers, etc., which have elements inside them"
14839,"factors on which the heating effect of current depends there are two factors on which the heating effect of current depends: (i) resistance of wire: greater the resistance of a wire, greater will be the heat produced in it by a given current, e.g"
14840,"if we choose two wires, one of copper and other is nichrome of equal length and equal thickness and pass them the equal amount of current through them for the same duration, then we will notice that nichrome wire will become hotter in comparison to the copper wire"
14841,it is due to the reason that the resistance of nichrome wire is more than that of the copper wire
14842,"that is why the nichrome wire is used to make heating elements of electric heating appliances such as electric room heater, electric iron, etc"
14843,"the resistance of a wire depends on the material of the wire, length of wire and thickness of the wire"
14844,"(ii) magnitude of current passed through a given wire: if the magnitude of current passed through a given wire is greater, then the heat produced in it will also be greater, e.g"
14845,"if a normal amount of current flows through the copper wires of household electric wiring, then the wires do not become much hot but if a large current flows in the same wiring accidentally, then the wires become extremely hot and a fire may be started"
14846,"applications of the heating effect of current some of the important applications of heating effect of electric current are for the production of light, the heating effect of electric current is utilised in the electric bulbs"
14847,"for the working of electrical heating appliances such as water heater, electric room heater, electric iron, etc., the heating effect of electric current is utilised"
14848,the heating effect of electric current is utilised in a safety device called ‘electric fuse’
14849,compact fluorescent lamps (cfls) an electric bulb is basically used for producing light but it also releases the heat which is not desirable because a major part of the electricity consumed by the filament of a bulb is converted into heat and results in the wastage of electricity
14850,"so, this wastage can be decreased by using fluorescent tube light or cfls (as shown in the figure) in place of the bulbs"
14851,"however, before purchasing bulbs, tubes orcfl’s we should look for the isi marl"
14852,it is because the isi mark ensures that the appliance is safe and wastage of energy is minimum
14853,electric fuse a safety device which works on the heating effect of current and prevents electric fires or damage to electrical appliances due to excessive flow of current is known as the fuse
14854,this safety device consists of a short length of a thin wire of tin plated copper having a low melting point and this wire has a much greater resistance than the rest of the electric wiring in the house
14855,"so, due to this, if the current in the electric wiring suddenly increases too much, then the fuse wire gets heated, then it melts and breaks the circuit which means that the current flowing in the household circuit will stop"
14856,"this prevents fire in the house and also the damage of various electrical appliances like refrigerator, fans, tube lights, tv, etc"
14857,"when a fuse gets blown (breaks), a new fuse has to be fitted in its place in order to restore the electricity supply in the household circuit"
14858,note: we should not use a thick wire as a fuse wire because it will have low resistance and thus it will not get heated to its melting point ‘ when a large current passes through it
14859,cause of large current flow in household electric wiring an extremely large current can flow in the household electric wiring circuits under two circumstances overloading and short circuit
14860,we might have read reports in the newspaper about fires caused by short circuits and overloading
14861,"overloading it is a situation when too many electrical appliances are connected to a single socket, they draw an extremely large amount of current from the household circuit"
14862,the flow of large current due to overloading may heat the copper wires of household wiring to a very high temperature and fire may be started
14863,short circuit electric current is supplied by household through two insulated wires which run together and reach each and every electrical appliances
14864,one insulated wire is called live wire and the other insulated wire is called neutral wire and both these wires are necessary for the working of an electrical appliance (say an electric iron)
14865,"so, if in case the plastic insulation of the live wire and the neutral wire gets worn due to wear and tear, then the two naked wires touch each other"
14866,"so, this touching of live wire and neutral wire directly is known as a short circuit"
14867,due to which a large current flows through the household wiring and this large’ current may heat the wires to a dangerously high temperature and a fire may be started
14868,note: always use proper fuses which have been specified for particular applications carrying isi mark never use just any wire or strip of metal in place of a fuse
14869,miniature circuit breakers (mcbs) this ore increasingly being used these days in place of fuses
14870,mcb does not work on the heating effect of current as it works on the magnetic effect of current
14871,these switches outomaticouy turn off when the current in a circuit exceeds the safe limit
14872,we turn them on and the circuit ¡s once again completed
14873,"magnetic effect of electric current if the electric current passes through a wire, then the current carrying wire behaves like a magnet"
14874,"it was discovered by a scientist hans christian oersted who found that when an electric current is passed in a wire, then the compass needle placed near it got deflected from its usual north-south position"
14875,a straight wire carrying an electric current produces a magnetic effect
14876,the magnetic effect is increased only if we use a long coil of wire instead of a straight wire
14877,even further the magnetic effect is increased if the coil of wire is wound around an iron rod and then current is passed through it
14878,an electromagnet consists of a coil of insulated wire wrapped around a piece of iron which is magnetised only when an electric current is passed through the coil
14879,"this magnet consists of a long coil of insulated copper wire wound around an iron rod and when the two ends of the coil get connected to a cell, then a current passes through the coil and produces a magnetic effect"
14880,the magnetism of an electromagnet remains as long as the current is flowing in its coil
14881,"so, if we switch off the current in the coil, then all the magnetism of the iron rod disappear and it will no longer behave like a magnet"
14882,"there are two factors through which an electromagnet can be made stronger, i.e"
14883,"uses of electromagnets these magnets are used in electrical appliances such as an electric bell, electric fan, electric motor"
14884,these magnets have their utilisation in electric generators where the very strong magnetic field is required
14885,for deflecting electron beam of the picture tube of tv electromagnets are used
14886,"for the magnetic separation of iron ores from the earthly substances, electromagnets are used"
14887,advantages of electromagnets over permanent magnets an electromagnet is a temporary form of the magnet because its magnetism is only for the duration of current flowing in its coil
14888,"actually, an electromagnet is better than a permanent magnet in many respects"
14889,there are some of the advantages of the electromagnets over the permanent magnets which are stated as follows: the magnetism of an electromagnet can be switched on or switched off as desired
14890,by increasing the number of turns in the coil and by increasing the current passing through the coil an electromagnet can be made very strong
14891,"on the other hand, a permanent magnet cannot be made so strong"
14892,electric bell an electric bell works on the magnetic effect of current
14893,construction of electric bell the electric bell has a u-shaped electromagnet
14894,there is a small iron bar called armature which is h^d in front of the poles of the electromagnet
14895,the lower end of the iron bar is attached to a flat spring and the flat spring is itself fixed to a metal bracket
14896,the upper end of the iron bar has a clapper attach to it
14897,"working of electric bell in order to ring the bell, first of all, we press the push button switch in order to ring the bell"
14898,"so, when we press the switch, then the electric circuit of the bell is completed and a current passes through the coil of the electromagnet and it gets magnetised"
14899,"so, as the armature moves towards the poles of the electromagnet, the clapper attached to it strikes the gong and produces a ringing sound"
14900,"when the armature moves towards the magnet, its contact with the contact screw is broken"
14901,"due to this, the electric circuit breaks and no current flows in the electromagnet coil"
14902,the electromagnet loses its magnetism for a moment and the armature is no longer attracted by it
14903,the flat spring brings back the iron armature to its original position and the clapper also moves away from the gong
14904,as soon as the armature comes back and touches the contact screw the circuit is completed and current starts flowing in the electromagnet coil again
14905,the electromagnet attracts the iron armature once again and the clapper strikes the gong again producing a ringing sound
14906,"so, this process of ‘make and break’ of the electric circuit continues as long as we are pressing the switch"
14907,"due to this, the armature vibrates forwards and backwards rapidly each time making the clapper strike the gong"
14908,"thus, the clapper strikes the gong rapidly producing an almost continuous sound"

14911,the metre is the standard unit of distance and second is the standard unit of time
14912,"so, the standard unit of speed is metre per second (m/s)"
14913,"the large values of speed are expressed in kilometre per hour (km/h) and in this case, the distance travelled is measured in terms of kilometre and time taken is measured in an hour"
14914,"the small values of speed are expressed in centimetre per second (cm/s) and in this case, the distance travelled is measured in terms of centimetre and time taken is measured in second"
14915,"if we have to compare the speeds of a number of objects, then we must express the speeds of all those objects in the same unit"
14916,measurement of time a duration or moment in which things occur is known as time
14917,"with the help of clocks and watches, we generally measure time"
14918,it is very difficult to think that how did the people in ancient time measure times as they did not have clocks or watches
14919,"in order to measure the time, ancient people used some natural events which repeated regularly after fix time intervals, e.g"
14920,they found that the sun rises every day in the morning
14921,"so, the time between one sunrise and the next i was known as a day"
14922,"in a similar manner, time from one full moon to the next full moon was"
14923,a year was fixed as the time taken by the earth to complete one revolution of the sun
14924,many time measuring devices were used in different parts of the world before the pendulum clocks became popular
14925,sundials water clocks and sand clocks are some examples of such devices
14926,note (i) a sundial measures time by the position of the shadow cast by the sun
14927,(ii) the device which uses the flow of sand from one glass bulb to another in order to measure time is known as a sand clock (iii) a device which uses the rate at which water drip from one vessel to another measure time interval is known as a water clock simple pendulum a simple pendulum consists of a small metal ball called bob which is suspended by a long thread from rigid support such that bob is free to swing back and forth
14928,the to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of periodic or oscillatory motion
14929,galileo was the first person to study the motion of a pendulum
14930,a pendulum completes every swing or every oscillation in exactly the same time provided its length should be kept constant
14931,"the pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob starting from its mean position f, moves to d, to e and back to f"
14932,the pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position d to the other extreme position e and come back to d
14933,"so, the time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period"
14934,the length of a pendulum is the length of thread from the point of suspension to the centre of the bob
14935,he found that a pendulum of a given length tabes always the same time to complete one oscillation
14936,units of time second is the basic unit (or standard unit) of measuring time and it is represented by symbol s
14937,"1 h = 60 min and 1 min = 60 s different units of time are used depending on the need, e.g"
14938,"in order to express the longer time interval, the bigger units of time are used, i.e"
14939,"1 day = 24 h, 1 month = 30 days and 1 year = 12 months note: nowadays, most clocks or watches have an electric circuit with one or more cells"
14940,the time measured by quartz clocks is much more accurate than that by the clocks available earlier
14941,"measuring speed we have learnt how to measure distance and time, we can calculate the speed of an object"
14942,"now, we should learn how to measure the speed by doing an activity"
14943,speedometer and odometer the speedometer is an instrument on a vehicle’s dashboard which indicates the speed of the vehicle when it is moving
14944,this instrument tells us the speed of a running vehicle at that instant of time in kilometre per hour
14945,a panel of instruments fitted on the top of a scooter or a motorcycle
14946,"in the same way, metres can be seen on the dashboard of cars, buses and other vehicles in addition to the speedometer, there is another instrument in a vehicle called odometer"
14947,an instrument which is used for measuring the distance travelled by a vehicle is known as an odometer
14948,"usually, a small rectangular window within speedometer dial with the symbol km (as shown in the figure) gives the (metre) odometer reading"
14949,"graphical representation of motion by drawing the distance-time graph, the motion of an object can be represented in diagram form"
14950,a distance-time graph represents how the distance travelled by a moving object changes with time
14951,"method to draw distance-time graph to draw a distance-time graph, use a graph paper"
14952,"for drawing the distance-time graph for a moving object, we require the readings of distances travelled by the object and the corresponding time values which have been obtained experimentally"
14953,"now, write time (min) on x-axis and distance (km) on the y-axis and also put arrows with them"
14954,"in this problem, we have only small time values (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min) to represent"
14955,"so, the scale to be used for showing time can be 2 min = 2 cm"
14956,"here, we mark the time values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 on the line ox as shown in the figure given as alongside"
14957,"again, the distance values given in this problem are small (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 km)"
14958,"so, the scale to be used for representing distance values on the graph can be 2 km = 2 cm"
14959,"we now mark the distance values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 on the line oy (see figure)"
14960,we can see in the graph that the first reading given in this problem is time = 0 and distance = 0
14961,the point o (called origin) represents the 0 (zero) values both for time and distance
14962,"therefore, at point o on graph paper, time is 0 and distance is also 0"
14963,the second reading is time = 2 min and distance = 2 km
14964,"now, the vertical line above the 2 min mark on the graph paper and horizontal line on the right side of 2 km mark on graph paper cross at point a (see figure)"
14965,"in the same way, the third, fourth, fifth and sixth readings of time and the corresponding readings of distance will give us points b, c, d and e on the graph paper which are marked as pencil dots (see figure)"
14966,"after joining the point o and the dots at point a, b, c, d and e with a pencil line, we will get a straight line graph oe (see figure)"
14967,"so, this is the required distance-time graph for the motion of the car"
14968,"since the distance-time graph for the motion of the car is a straight line, so from here we can conclude that the car is moving with a constant speed (or uniform speed)"
14969,"other types of graph we generally see while reading newspapers, magazine, etc., that the present information is represented in various forms of graphs in order to make it interesting"
14970,these graphs generally bar graphs and pie chart as shown in the figure
14971,a diagram which shows information as thin rectangles (known as bars) of different heights is known as a bar graph
14972,"in this graph, the position and heights of the bars represent the values of the variable quantity about which information is being given"
14973,"a kind of graph or diagram which shows the percentage composition of something in the form of slices of a circle (the whole circle representing 100 per cent), is known as a pie chart"
14974,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 13 motion and time pdf free download will help you
14975,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 13 motion and time, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
14976,it supports plant growth by holding the roots firmly and supplying water and nutrients to the plants
14977,"it acts as a natural habitat for many organisms like an earthworm, fungi, bacteria, ants, etc"
14978,"it is also essential for agriculture which provides us with food, clothing and shelter for all"
14979,"therefore, we can say that soil is an inseparable part of our life"
14980,"soil teeming with life soil contains air, water and countless living organisms like fungi, bacteria, insects (like ants and beetles), earthworms, rodents, moles and plant roots"
14981,some organisms are too small that they cannot be seen by naked eyes (e.g
14982,"an important soil organism is an earthworm, it is visible only in the rainy season"
14983,soil pollution sometimes people throw polythene bags and plastic articles in the soil
14984,they pollute the soil and also hill the useful organisms living in the soil
14985,some other substances like chemicals and pesticides also pollute the soil
14986,"to prevent the soil pollution, the use of polythene bags must be banned, and the waste products and chemicals must be treated before they are released into the soil"
14987,the use of pesticides in the agricultural field must also be minimised in order to prevent soil pollution
14988,"soil profile soil is formed by breaking down of rocks by the action of wind, water or climate by the process called weathering"
14989,"during this process, the rocks are worn away to form small particles by long exposure to the elements of weather"
14990,weathering is a very slow process as it takes thousands of years for a huge rock to turn into fine particles
14991,the nature of the soil depends upon the rocks from which it has been formed and types of vegetation that grow on it
14992,the soil profile is a vertical section through different layers of the soil
14993,soil profile consists of different layers of soil which are called horizon
14994,a-horizon or topsoil it is the uppermost layer of soil and is usually dark in colour because of the presence of minerals and humus in it
14995,it provides the nutrients in plants since the roots of most plants are confined to this layer
14996,"humus is the dark brown coloured layer which consists of dead, rotting remains of plants and animals"
14997,this layer is generally soft and retains more water in it
14998,"this layer provides shelter for many living organisms like earthworm, rodents, moles and beetles"
14999,b-horizon or subsoil this layer of soil lies just below the topsoil
15000,it is made up of slightly bigger rock particles than that of the topsoil
15001,it does not have much humus and is lighter in colour than topsoil
15002,this layer is less fertile than topsoil and contains few living organisms
15003,c-horizon or substratum the layer of soil which lies just below the subsoil is called c-horizon
15004,"it consists of small pieces of broken rocks with cracks and crevices, formed by the weathering of bedrock or parent rock"
15005,bedrock or parent rock below the c-horizon unweathered solid rock is found which is called as bedrock
15006,it is non-porous and can produce the soil over a long period of time
15007,this layer is hard enough and is difficult to dig with a spade
15008,"soil types the weathering of rocks produces small particles of various materials, these include sand and clay"
15009,the relative amount of sand and clay depends upon the rock from which the particles were formed
15010,the rock particles present in soil are of different sizes and chemical compositions
15011,"on the basis of sizes, the rock particles present in soil can be divided mainly into four major groups: (i) clay, these are formed by the smallest rock particles"
15012,these are so small that we cannot see a single clay particle and it feels smooth
15013,(ii) silt these are made up of somewhat bigger rock particle than clay
15014,"(iii) sand, these are made up of larger particles enough than that of silt and can be easily seen"
15015,(iv) gravel these are the largest sized rock particles that are present in the soil
15016,these are the tiny stones that are present in topsoil in very small quantity
15017,"the soil in different geographical areas contains different proportions of sand, clay and silt in them"
15018,"depending upon its composition, soil can be classified as sandy soil, clayey soil and loamy soil"
15019,the size of the particles in the soil influences its properties
15020,there are large spaces between them which are filled with air
15021,"the sandy soil tends to be light, well aerated and rather dry"
15022,"since it is aerated, can be ploughed easily and cannot retain water, so it is not good for plants"
15023,"since it is light, it can be easily blown away if left bare"
15024,it can be made fertile by adding manure in them which increases its water-holding capacity
15025,"this soil is not sticky and therefore, these cannot be used to make pots, bricks, toys and statues"
15026,(ii) clayey soil’ clay particles are smaller and packed tightly so that it leaves a little space for air
15027,the fertility of clayey soil can be improved by adding some sand and humus to it
15028,"clayey soil is very sticky and can be used to make pots, bricks, toys, statues, etc"
15029,"(iii) loamy soil it is a mixture of sand, clay and silt with a small amount of humus in it"
15030,"therefore, it is very fertile and the best topsoil for growing plants"
15031,it has water holding capacity and excess water can also be drained out through it easily
15032,properties of soil soil possesses various properties like: it contains air
15033,it can absorb or soak water it allows water to pass down through it
15034,"when water is poured over it, then some water gets absorbed in the soil and rest passes down the soil"
15035,the process of passing down water slowly through the soil is called percolation of water
15036,"percolation rate is the amount of water (in ml) that is percolated through the soil in unit time, i.e"
15037,"the rate of percolation can be calculated by using the following formula: percolation rate (ml/min) = \(\frac { amount of water (ml) }{ percolation time (min) }\) for example, if water in bottle ‘a’ percolates in 20 min, in ‘b ’, it percolates in f 15 min in bottle"
15038,"while in bottle ‘c’, it percolates in 25 min, then the percolation rate (ml/min) will be calculated as follows: for bottle ‘a’, rate of percolation = \(\frac { 200 ml }{ 20 min }\) =10 ml/min for bottle ‘b rate of percolation = \(\frac { 200 ml }{ 15 min }\) = 13 ml/min for bottle ‘c’, rate of percolation = \(\frac { 200 ml }{ 25 min }\) = 8 ml/min percolation rate is highest in sandy soil because it is very loose"
15039,"on the other hand, clayey soil is very compact and therefore has the lowest rate of percolation"
15040,the rainwater moves or reaches to well faster and in a greater amount from sandy soil
15041,these are the best soil to grow paddy because paddy requires standing water in fields
15042,the kutcha (unpaved) road due to percolation of water becomes dry after rain while pakka road does not
15043,moisture in soil the soil contains some water in it which is called soil moisture
15044,"usually, ‘moisture is present as a thin film around the soil particles"
15045,"thus, the moisture content of the soil is very important for the growth of crops"
15046,absorption of water by soil soil contains moisture in it but it can still absorb or soak a lot of water
15047,the ability or capacity of the soil to absorb a limit of water is called absorption percentage
15048,"it can be calculated as follows: percentage of water absorbed = \(\frac { amount of water absorbed (in ml) }{ amount of soil(g) }\) × 100 different types of soil can absorb water to a different extent, i.e"
15049,"when we talk about the percentage of water absorbed by the soil, it means the mass of water absorbed by 100 g of soil"
15050,water retention the ability of soil to hold water is called water retention
15051,the space between soil particles is called pores provide the passage for gases and moisture within the soil
15052,the ability of soil to retain water is strongly related to the particle size
15053,water molecules hold more lightly to the fine particles of the clayey soil than the coarser particle of sandy soil
15054,"when we perform this activity with different soil samples, we will see that"
15055,sandy soil will absorb less water and allows more water to percolate
15056,a clayey soil will absorb more water but allow less water to percolate
15057,sandy soil will absorb less water than clayey soil because of the large spaces between the soil particles
15058,"the area where, there is a lot of clay in the soil, stagnant water collects above the soil whenever it rains"
15059,soil and crops different types of soil are found in different parts of india
15060,"soil is mainly affected by wind, rainfall, temperature, light and humidity"
15061,some climatic factors also affect the soil profile and bring changes in the soil structure
15062,the plants that grow on the surface of the earth are called vegetation
15063,"it includes green grass, herbs, shrubs, bushes, crop plants and trees"
15064,the component of soil along with various climatic factors determine the type of vegetation in a particular region
15065,clayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat and gram
15066,"for paddy, soils rich in clay and organic matter and having a good capacity to retain water are ideal"
15067,"for lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils which drain water easily, are required"
15068,"for cotton, sandy-loam or loam, which drain water easily and can hold plenty of air, are more suitable"
15069,crops such as wheat are grown in the fine clayey soils because they are rich in humus and are very fertile
15070,"a case study john, rashida and radha went to leeladhar dada and santosh malviya ofsohagpur in madhya pradesh"
15071,"leeladhar dada was preparing the soil to make items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan), etc"
15072,"a summary of conversation they all had with leeladhar dada is given below: leeladhar and other porters, bring the black soil from a piece of barren land"
15073,"dry soil is then placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles, etc"
15074,after removing these things the soil is then soaked for around 8 hours
15075,this kneaded soil is then placed on the wheel and appropriate shape is given
15076,these items are baked at high temperature after drying in air and then coloured
15077,soil erosion the removal of land surface by water wind or ice is known as erosion
15078,"the topsoil is very fertile and in the absence of it, the plants cannot grow"
15079,soil erosion is mainly caused by the large scale cutting of forest trees and plants
15080,erosion of soil is more severe in the areas of little or no surface vegetation like the desert or barren land
15081,"the effects of soil erosion are, famines, flood desertification and damage or spoilage of environment"

15083,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 9 soil, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
15084,"snow or ice (solid) exists on the earth in the form of ice caps at the poles of the earth, glaciers and snow covered mountains"
15085,"water (liquid) is present in oceans, lakes, rivers and even underground water in the earth’s upper layers"
15086,clouds (gas) are found in the form of water vapour present in the atmosphere
15087,"on condensation, it turns into droplets and precipitates on earth’s surface in the form of rain"
15088,the continuous recycling of these forms of water takes place and the amount of water on the earth is maintained of constant
15089,"most of the urban areas have a system of water supply whereas underdeveloped/undeveloped areas depend on resources like rivers, lakes, ponds, handpumps, etc"
15090,"groundwater as an important source of water the wells, tubewells and handpumps are the main sources of water for many people"
15091,it is the upper level of underground water which occupies all the spaces in the soil and rocks and form a water table as shown in the figure below: the upper limit of groundwater is called water table
15092,it represents the depth of water filled area at a given place
15093,the water table rises and falls depending upon the amount of rainwater that seeps into the groundwater and how much groundwater is drawn out for irrigation and industry
15094,the seeping down of rainwater into the groundwater is called infiltration
15095,"at some places, the groundwater is stored between layers of hard rock below the water table"
15096,this is aquifer which contains the groundwater usable by tubewells and handpumps
15097,"these sources however, have limited sources of water and may get exhausted if used excessively"
15098,depletion of water table water drawn from underground water gets replenished by seepage of rainwater
15099,the water table does not get affected as long as we draw the same amount of water as is replenished by natural resources like rain
15100,"however, there is a number of factors which cause depletion of water table at a very fast rate which is really a matter of concern for every one of us"
15101,"increase in population, industrial and agricultural activities are some common factors affecting water table"
15102,"scanty rainfall, deforestation and decrease in the effective area for seepage of water may also deplete the water table"
15103,"increasing population as our population increases, we need more water for drinking, washing, cooking and cleaning"
15104,"we also need more number of houses, offices, shops and roads"
15105,this means more construction work and construction itself uses lots of water itself
15106,"besides this, there is less open area which can seep in the rain water into the ground"
15107,this results in depletion of groundwater level to alarmingly low levels (in many cities)
15108,almost everything that we use needs water somewhere in its production process
15109,most of the water used in the industries is drawn from groundwater
15110,agricultural activities more food is needed to meet the requirement as there is an increase in population
15111,"in our country, farmers depend on rain, canal water or groundwater for irrigation"
15112,"since rain is often erratic, canals also suffer frequently from lack of water"
15113,deforestation large scale deforestation has occurred to accommodate the growing population to grow food for them and to provide space for industries
15114,overgrazing by our animals has also destroyed large amount of vegetation
15115,the green coverage of vegetation slows down the flow of water on land and increases the absorption of water by the soil
15116,"cutting down of trees and vegetation, therefore interferes with the natural processes by which seepage takes place and the groundwater is recharged and causes depletion of water"
15117,distribution of water the distribution of water over the globe is quite uneven due to the number of factors
15118,"on the other hand, these are deserts which have scanty rainfall"
15119,some regions have excessive rains which cause floods while some others have very little rainfall which causes drought
15120,india is a vast country and the rainfall is not the same everywhere
15121,"therefore, some regions in our country may have floods while others may suffer from droughts at the same time"
15122,water resources in india india receives a lot of precipitation (rain and snow) in comparison to the rest of the world
15123,the average annual precipitation in india is 1170 mm as compared to the world’s average of 700 mm
15124,the rain map of india showing average rainfall in the different parts of our country
15125,based upon survey of india map with the permission of the surveyor general of india
15126,the territorial waters of india extend into the sea to a distance of twelve nautical miles measured from the appropriate baseline
15127,the external boundaries and coastlines of india agree with the record/master copy certified by survey of india
15128,"water management it is the activity of planning, developing, distribution and managing the optimum use of water resources"
15129,water supply pipes leaking and a lot of water gushing out of the pipes are the wastage of water
15130,it is the responsibility of the civic authorities to prevent such wastage of precious water
15131,mismanagement or wastage may also take place at the level of individuals also
15132,"all of us knowingly or unknowingly waste water, we should also take care for it"
15133,some of the steps which can be taken for the proper management of water are given below: rainwater harvesting bawris drip irrigation 1
15134,"the modern buildings of schools, offices, homes can install a rainwater harvesting system, so as to store rainwater in their own premises for future use"
15135,a case study bhujpur in the kutch area of gujarat has a very erratic rainfall
15136,the only source of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water throughout the year
15137,"in 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to harvest rainwater"
15138,eighteen chech-dams were built on ruhmavati river and its tributaries where water percolates through the soil and recharge the aquifers
15139,"^ according to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation"
15140,"these structures are still found in old buildings, palaces and forts"
15141,"with time, the bawris fell into disuse and garbage started piling in these reservoirs"
15142,"however, because of the acute shortage of water, the bawris are being revived"
15143,today the situation is that inspite of scanty rains those places are managing their water needs well
15144,drip irrigation it is a method of watering plants by use of narrow tubings which deliver water directly to the base of a plant
15145,the mechanism of drip irrigation is shown in the figure given below: role for saving water you can be a leader to show people about water management skills
15146,"if any pipeline and tap water is leaking there, immediately report to authorities like ‘jal board’ (in delhi) to prevent water loss"
15147,educate people about water wise habits which can be developed gradually and will last life long once developed
15148,"water-wise habits turn off the tap while brushing, shaving and washing hand"
15149,use mug and water in the bucket for bathing instead of using showers
15150,irrigate potted plants with used water for washing rice and dal in the kitchen while cooking
15151,effect of water scarcity on plants we grow many plants in pots in our homes
15152,"if the potted plants are not watered even for a few days, the plants will ‘wilt’ (become limp) and ultimately ‘dry up’"
15153,"if potted plants are not given water for a considerable time, they will die"
15154,"thus, sufficient water is essential for maintaining the life of plants"
15155,plants need water to obtain nutrients from the soil and to make food by the process of photosynthesis
15156,the various effects of water scarcity on plants are water scarcity will affect nutrient uptake from soil by the plants
15157,"the rate of photosynthesis will decline, so oxygen evolved will be less"
15158,"rate of transpiration will also decline, so water vapours released in the atmosphere by transpiration will be less, it will disturb the water cycle"
15159,"so, in brief, we can say the shortage of water will lead to a shortage of food, shortage of oxygen and shortage of rain also"

15162,it creates wind the difference in atmospheric pressure gives rise to the wind on the earth
15163,"downward or upward movement of air caused due to differences in pressure creates the cloudy and clear sky, brings rain or fine weather"
15164,weather forecasting the changes in air pressure gives important clues for weather forecasting
15165,"similarly, when we ride a bicycle against the direction of the wind, boat against wind direction or flying of kite against the direction of the wind, we can feel the air pressure"
15166,"when we pump air or fill air into the bicycle tube, the air molecules inside the tube collide with the walls of the tube and exerts air pressure"
15167,the pressure exerted by air filled in a bicycle tube keeps the tube tight and makes the bicycle tyre feel hard
15168,"if we continuously fill more and more air into the bicycle tube, the air pressure in the bicycle tube will increase too much that tube may get burst"
15169,air moves from the region of higher pressure to the lower pressure
15170,"the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the air moves"
15171,it is due to the heat of the sun from which air becomes warm producing a low pressure
15172,"so, the warm air rises up and the cool air from the surroundings moves towards the sea"
15173,the fast-moving air blowing over an object helps in lifting the object up by producing a region of low pressure above it
15174,air pressure is caused due to the constant bombardment by moving air molecules on the surface of the paper strip
15175,"we have learnt that when high-speed air is blown over a strip of paper, it is lifted up"
15176,"similarly, if the high wind blows over the roof of houses, it will reduce the air pressure above the roofs and if the roofs of houses are weak then higher air pressure from below will lift up the roofs which can then be blown away by the fast winds"
15177,"therefore, weak roofs of houses can be lifted and blown away by the high-speed wind that is called a storm"
15178,air expands on heating gases or air expand more than solid and liquid on heating
15179,warm air rises up whereas comparatively cool air tends to sink towards the earth’s surface
15180,the term ‘expansion of air’ means the increase in the volume of air
15181,"when the air is heated, its volume increases and occupies a bigger space"
15182,"when the air is heated, it becomes lighter and rises up in the sky"
15183,"this is the reason that when we burn woods, the smoke rises along with the hot air near the place of fire"
15184,this fact of air is utilised in launching hot air balloons
15185,"in nature, there are several situations where warm air rises at a place"
15186,the cold air from the surrounding areas rushes in to fill its place
15187,wind currents the wind is the movement of air which depends on the difference in air pressure in two regions
15188,air moves from the region of high pressure to the region of low pressure in the atmosphere
15189,this difference in air pressure is created by uneven heating or unequal heating on the earth
15190,"the region where the air rises, an area of low pressure is created while the region where the air sinks, an area of high pressure is created"
15191,the uneven heating on the earth takes place in two situations: 1
15192,uneven heating between the equator and the poles the region of the earth which is closed to the equator of the earth gets the maximum heat from the sun
15193,"therefore, the air in these regions gets warm and rises, creating an area of low air pressure"
15194,the cooler air from the region of upto 30 degrees latitudes belt on either side of the equator moves or rushes towards the equator and replaces the warm rising air
15195,this makes the wind to blow from the north and south directions towards the equator
15196,"at the poles, the air is colder than at latitudes about 60 degrees"
15197,"therefore, the warmer air moves upward and colder air rushes in"
15198,this makes the wind blow from the poles of the earth towards the warmer region up to about 60-degree latitudes
15199,"uneven heating of land and water (i) during summer, the earth near the equator warms faster than the water in the oceans"
15200,the air above the land gets warmer and rises up in the sky creating a low-pressure area
15201,these winds carry a lot of moisture with them and bring rain
15202,the wind blows from the land to the sea due to the difference in air temperature between the land and sea
15203,"this happens so because during winter, the land cools down faster than the water in the oceans and the temperature of water in the ocean is higher than that of land"
15204,the warm air over the ocean rises up creating a region of low pressure and cooler air from the land rushes towards the ocean
15205,"thus, the air flows from land to ocean carrying only a little water vapour"
15206,"hence, bring only a small amount of rain in the winter season"
15207,note: the word monsoon is taken from the arabic word ‘mausam’ which means ‘season’ the summer monsoon which brings heavy rain is very important to the farmers because this annual rainfall helps in growing crops
15208,farmers depend on the rain for the irrigation of their crops
15209,"in nature itself, there are certain situations that can sometimes create disasters and can pose a threat to humans, animals and plant life"
15210,"wind speed and wind direction play an important role in the formation of storms, cyclone, thunderstorms, etc"
15211,the instrument used to measure the wind speed is called anemometer
15212,"thunderstorms when air moves gently (low speed), it is called a breeze while when it moves violently (high speed), it is called a storm"
15213,"when the pressure of air drops, it indicates the possibility of a storm"
15214,"the swift movement of the falling water along with the rising warm air producing sound, lightning, heavy rain and • strong wind is called thunderstorm"
15215,it develops in hot and humid tropical areas like india and is accompanied by heavy rains or hail
15216,thunderstorms are produced by the dark clouds which form at fairly low altitude in the atmosphere
15217,"in the tropical area, the air gets warmed up and makes it to rise, whereas humidity provides the water vapour for the formation of cloud"
15218,"therefore, it can be said that to occur a thunderstorm, it requires moisture, rapidly rising warm air and sea breeze or mountains"
15219,precautions to be taken during a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is accompanied by lightning which is a giant electric spark
15220,"therefore, you must take the following precautions during a thunderstorm to protect ourselves from the lightning"
15221,when you are in open area do not take shelter under an isolated tree or building
15222,"if you are in a forest, take shelter under a small tree"
15223,do not take shelter under an umbrella having a metallic end
15224,"never sit near a window, open garages, storage sheds, metal sheds, etc, to take shelter"
15225,"if you are in the water, get out and go inside a building"
15226,when you are inside do not sit near an open window
15227,do not watch tv cyclones a cyclone is a weather condition consisting of a system of high-speed winds revolving around a central area of very low pressure
15228,it is a violent storm with a wind speed of 150-250 km/h
15229,structure of a cyclone the centre of a cyclone is a calm area and is called the eye of the storm
15230,the diameter of the eye varies from 10 to 30 km
15231,it is a region free of clouds and has light winds
15232,"around this calm and clear eye, there is a cloud region of about 150 km in size"
15233,"in this region, there are high speed winds (150-250 km/h) and thick clouds with heavy rains"
15234,"note: cyclones are developed over the indian ocean, bay of bengal and arabian sea"
15235,"meteorologists study weather and give various names to the cyclones as hugo, katrina, rita, hud-hud, phailin, etc"
15236,"formation of cyclones factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and rotation of the earth, contribute to the development of a cyclone"
15237,the energy required to form and sustain a cyclone comes from the heat of condensation of water vapour present in moist air rising from the surface of hot seawater that condenses at altitudes to form a 0cloud
15238,"when the air above the seawater is heated, a region of low pressure is created because warm and moist air rises up"
15239,* the cool air rushes in forcing up more hot air
15240,the process of moving warm air up and its replacement by cool air is repeated again and again making or setting up a cycle or air current
15241,"once the cyclone is formed, it begins to move over the surface of the sea"
15242,the strongest wind and the heaviest rain occur in the towering thunder clouds about 20-30 kilometres from the centre of the cyclone
15243,cyclone comes to an end quickly if a cyclone moves over land because it no longer receives heat energy and moisture from warm seawater
15244,note: a cyclone is known by different names in different parts of the world
15245,cyclones cause widespread destruction and loss of life in coastal areas
15246,"when the strong winds push water towards the shore even if the storm is hundreds of kilometre away, it gives the first indication of an approaching cyclone"
15247,the high-speed wind accompanying cyclone produces a tremendous force of the high-speed wind
15248,"it causes damage by toppling trees, electric poles, telephone poles and vehicles, damage houses and even hurt people, thus causing a great loss of life and property"
15249,the low pressure in the eye lifts the water surface in the centre
15250,the rising water may be as high as 3-12 m and appears like a water-wall moving towards the shore
15251,"as a result, the seawater enters the low-lying coastal areas and can destroy roads and railway tracks, wash away vehicles, damage houses, drown people and animals, damage crops causing a great loss of life and property"
15252,continuous heavy rains caused by cyclones may further worsen the flood situation in the area and affect the people in coastal area
15253,the flood may pollute drinking water and may cause several water-borne diseases
15254,effective safety measures on the part of the government cyclone forecast and warning system must be installed
15255,information about cyclone should be given to the people in time through rapid communication system
15256,an administrative arrangement should be taken to move people faster to safer places
15257,"on the part of the people people should follow the essential guidelines provided by the agencies through tv radio, phones, etc"
15258,"a proper arrangement should be made to shift the essential household goods, domestic animals, etc"
15259,avoid driving on a road which is underwater because flood might have damaged the road
15260,"phone numbers of all the emergency services like police, fire brigade, hospitals, etc"
15261,"some other precautions to be taken when you are staying in a cyclone hit area do not drink water that could be contaminated, store drinking water for emergencies"
15262,tornadoes a tornado is a violent spinning storm in the shape of a dark funnel with a narrow end on the land
15263,these are formed over the sea and are called water spouts
15264,tornado develops from the thunderstorm and is formed mostly on the land
15265,these are violent and can reach the speeds of more than 500 km/h destroying everything in their path
15266,these are not very common in india but occurs in canada and the usa
15267,"when the warm air from the earth’s surface rises up, it whirls around it and causes very high-speed winds"
15268,from a few meters to a few hundred meters but the wind speed can rise as high as 500 km/h
15269,"the funnel of tornado sucks up everything at its bases like dust, debris, cars, trees and even houses"
15270,destruction caused by tornadoes tornado causes much damage due to the heavy force of its high-speed winds
15271,"tornado causes the following destructions: it uproots trees, electric poles and telephone poles, it disrupts power supply and telecommunications"
15272,it lifts the people and vehicles off the ground and hurls them hundreds of metre away
15273,this may lead to the death of people and damage to vehicles
15274,it creates lower pressure outside the building much lesser than inside the building and the building can explode
15275,protection from tornado the following precautions should be taken for protection during a tornado: one should take the shelter in a room situated deep inside the home having no windows or in a basement
15276,shut all the doors and windows and take shelter under the study table
15277,bend down on your knees and protect your head and neck using your arms
15278,"if someone is in the vehicle and tornado begins, he should get out of the vehicle and take shelter in a ditch or low-lying area and lie flat in it"
15279,"advanced technology has helped during the early part of the last century, the people residing in coastal regions have less than a day for the preparations or to evacuate their homes from an overcoming cyclone"
15280,we have satellites and radars which can issue the cyclone watch or cyclone alert before 48 hrs (in advance) of any expected storm and a cyclone warning is issued 24 hrs in advance
15281,"therefore, coastal residents have sufficient time to prepare and evacuate their homes"
15282,the message related to the cyclone is broadcasted over the ratio every hour or half hour when a cyclone is nearer the coast
15283,"in this way, the advanced technology has helped us in giving better protection from cyclones"
15284,"we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 8 winds, storms and cyclones pdf free download will help you"
15285,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 7 science notes chapter 8 winds, storms and cyclones, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
15286,blood it is a fluid tissue that flows in blood vessels
15287,it is red in colour and it flows through a network of tubes in whole body called blood vessels
15288,blood is pumped to every part of the animal by heart
15289,"plasma, red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs) and platelets"
15290,"plasma is a liquid while rbcs, wbcs and platelets that float in it"
15291,plasma it is the sticky liquid part of the blood which is pale yellow in colour
15292,it contains dissolved substance such as digested food and waste products and carry them from one part to another part in the body
15293,red blood cells (rbcs) rbcs are red in colour due to the presence of pigment called haemoglobin
15294,haemoglobin is a red protein that binds with oxygen and transports oxygen to all the parts of the body and ultimately to all the cells
15295,it is the presence of haemoglobin which makes the blood appear red
15296,"when haemoglobin binds with oxygen, it forms oxyhaemoglobin which is transported to various body parts"
15297,the carbon dioixde from the various body parts is transported back by binding again with haemoglobin
15298,"it forms carboxyhaemoglobin with c02, this c02 is expelled out from the body"
15299,white blood cells (wbcs) the wbcs fight against infection and protect us from diseases
15300,they can squeeze out of the blood vessels to reach any part of the body
15301,"platelets blood platelets are small, irregular, tiny fragments of special cells formed in the bone marrow"
15302,these are colourless and help in the clotting of blood in a cut or wound
15303,"if a cut or wound is made the blood starts flowing from it, after some time the platelets plug the cut and the bleeding stops due to the formation of a dark red clot"
15304,"if the platelets are not present in the blood, the blood flow from the cut or wound will not stop causing excess loss of blood which may be fatal to a person leading to death"
15305,functions of blood various functions of blood are it transports substances like digested food from the small intestine to the other parts of the body
15306,it carries waste products like urea from liver to kidney for excretion in urine
15307,blood vessels these are tubes or pipes that carry blood throughout the body
15308,it runs between the heart and the rest of the body
15309,"there are three major types of blood vessels in the body, i.e"
15310,arteries these carry blood from the heart to all the parts of the body
15311,these lie quite deep under our skin and cannot be seen easily
15312,arteries have thick elastic walls as the blood flows at high pressure due to pumping action from the heart through arteries
15313,it carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to all the parts of the body except the lungs
15314,another artery called the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle of the heart and carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs
15315,note: the arteries normally carry oxygenated blood from the heart but one artery called pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to lungs
15316,veins these are the blood vessels that carry blood from all the parts of the body back to the heart
15317,these tube-like blood vessels are situated just under the skin and can easily be seen as greenish-blue tubes or lines below the skin
15318,these carry deoxygenated blood from the body parts to the heart
15319,veins have thin walls and blood flows at low pressure through the veins
15320,"therefore, veins have valves in them which allow the blood to flow in one direction and prevent the backflow of blood in veins"
15321,"usually, veins carry deoxygenated blood but pulmonary vein that is connected to the left atrium of the heart carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart"
15322,"pulse rate to know your pulse rate, place the middle and index finger of your right hand on the inner side of your left wrist"
15323,this throbbing is called the pulse the pulse is produced due to the blood flowing in the arteries
15324,now count the number of beats or pulse in one minute
15325,the number of beats per minute is called the pulse rate
15326,"at the resting phase, a normal person has a pulse rate between 72-80 beats per minutes"
15327,"run for about 5 minutes and again measure the pulse rate, you will notice that the pulse rate per minute will be increased after running"
15328,capillaries these are extremely thin blood vessels that connect the arteries to veins
15329,these allow substances to pass from blood into the body cells and also from body cells into the blood
15330,"the exchange of substances like food, 02, c02, etc., between the blood and the body cells take place through the capillaries"
15331,"oxygenated and deoxygenated blood the blood that carry oxygen in it is called oxygenated blood, i.e"
15332,"the oxygenated blood comes from the lungs, where oxygen from the fresh air gets mixed into blood and is carried towards the heart"
15333,all oxygen has been used by tissues and organs is called deoxygenated blood
15334,it is formed in alt the organs of the body except lungs
15335,oxygenated blood is bright red in colour while deoxygenated blood is darher in colour
15336,blood groups the blood group of an individual human being always remains unchanged throughout their life
15337,"karl landsteiner described that human blood can be divided into four groups, i.e"
15338,these are named on the basis of substance present in the blood (rbc)
15339,every man has one of these four groups of blood which is inherited from parents to offspring and is never changed
15340,"if a person gets injured and heavy blood loss occurs, there is a need to give blood of other people to the patient"
15341,the person who gives the blood is called a donor while the person who receives the blood is called the recipient
15342,"before donation, the blood group must be matched because transfusion of different groups can be dangerous"
15343,the rbcs of the patient receiving blood will stick together and may cause the death of the patient
15344,"it can be shown as follows : heart the heart is an organ which beats continuously as a pump for the transport of blood carrying other substances with it, through a network of tubes or blood vessels"
15345,the heart pumps blood throughout our life without stopping or relaxing
15346,location of heart the heart is located in the chest cavity slightly towards the left side
15347,the heart is made up of special muscles called cardiac muscles that do not fatigue and are not the solid muscle
15348,the size of our heart is roughly equal to our left closed and is enclosed in a protective cover called pericardium fist
15349,structure of heart the heart has four compartments called as chambers
15350,"the upper two chambers of heart are called atria (sing, atrium) and the lower two chambers of heart are called ventricles"
15351,on the left side of heart are left atrium and left ventricle and on the right side of the heart are right atrium and right ventricle
15352,these are the muscular flaps that allow the blood to flow in only one direction
15353,the right side of the heart carries deoxygenated blood while the left side of the heart carries oxygenated blood
15354,the heart is separated by a partition called septum (from right side of the heart to the left side)
15355,this prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood inside the heart
15356,left and right side of the heart the left and right side of the heart act as two separate pumps
15357,"the left side of heart pumps the oxygenated blood into the whole body, while the right side of heart pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs"
15358,the oxygenated blood must be kept separated from deoxygenated blood to supply good amount of oxygen to the body cells for respiration and release of energy
15359,"if the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood will mix with each other, the body cells will not be able to get enough oxygen for respiration due to which less energy will be released in the body"
15360,heartbeat the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles that produce a specific sound of lubb-dubb is called heartbeat
15361,the average heartbeat of an adult person is 72-80 beats per minute at resting but the number increases during and after a physical exercise or when a person is excited
15362,"during fast beating of heart, the blood is pumped more rapidly to the organs to supply more oxygen to the body cells"
15363,the heartbeat is equal to the number of pulse in a minute
15364,stethoscope the heartbeat can be heard by an instrument called as stethoscope
15365,it is used by doctor to amplify the sound of heart
15366,it consists of a chest piece that carries a sensitive diaphragm two earpieces a tube joining both the parts doctors get to know about the condition of heart by listening to the sound through a stethoscope
15367,take a small funnel of 6-7cm in diameter and fix a rubber tube tightly on the stem of the funnel
15368,put the open end of the tube on one of your ear
15369,now place the mouth of the funnel on your chest near the heart
15370,mechanism of circulation the contraction of two atria is immediately followed by the contraction of two ventricles which leads to the continuous flow of blood in the human body
15371,the mechanism of circulation can be summarised as follows: the blood passes through the capillaries of the lungs and is mix with oxygen
15372,this oxygenated blood is then carried from the lungs to the left auricle by four pulmonary veins
15373,the left atrium contracts and the oxygenated blood is pushed into left ventricles
15374,the left ventricle pumps the blood into the biggest blood vessels of the body called aorta
15375,it distributes oxygen-rich blood to the different parts of the body
15376,the oxygenated blood is distributed to all the organs of the body through capillaries
15377,the deoxygenated blood from various organs of the body enters from the capillaries to veins and then to the right atrium
15378,the right atrium contracts and pushes the deoxygenated blood into right ventricles through the opened valve
15379,right ventricles pump the impure blood into pulmonary arteries that carry it to the right and left lungs for purification
15380,the co2 is released as a waste product from the lungs and again the blood absorbs oxygen and becomes oxygenated
15381,the valves present on both sides of heart regulate the blood flow from one chamber to another
15382,"this cycle keeps on circulating continuously day and night, even when we sleep"
15383,"the english physician, william harvey (ad 7578-1657), discovered the circulation of blood"
15384,the current opinion in those days was that blood oscillates in the vessels of the body
15385,"however, before he died, harvey’s idea about circulation was generally accepted as a biological fact"
15386,circulation in sponges and hydra sponges and hydra are simple animals that do not possess any circulatory system
15387,"they live in water and therefore, the food and oxygen enter into their body along with water"
15388,the water also carries the c02 and other waste material away from the body as it moves out of their bodies
15389,excretion the process of removal of waste materials produced in the cells of the living organism is called excretion
15390,"when our body uses food, water and air, it produces some by-products or unwanted substances"
15391,these waste material are toxic or poisonous and causes harm to the body
15392,these poisonous substances if get mixed with blood may become fatal and may cause the death of an organism
15393,"therefore, the waste material must be removed from the body so that a person may stay healthy"
15394,"these waste material produced after the various functions of body cells include co2, urea, sweat, etc"
15395,"these waste materials are removed from the body different organs of the body like lungs (co2), kidney (urea) and sweat glands (sweat)"
15396,these parts or organs of the body that are involved in the process of excretion are called excretory system
15397,excretory system in humans urea is the major waste product released in our body
15398,it is produced as a waste product of the decomposition of unused food proteins in the liver
15399,it is a poisonous substance which must be removed from the body
15400,"therefore, the kidney is the main excretory organ in our body"
15401,the urea and other unwanted salts when dissolving in water form a yellowish liquid waste called urine
15402,"it consists of 2.5% urea, 2.5% other waste salts and 95% water"
15403,an adult human being normally passes out 1-1.8 l of urine per day
15404,"the excretory system of human being consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder and a urethra"
15405,"kidney are bean-shaped organs present at the back of our body, just above the waist"
15406,"when the blood containing urea and other waste salts pass through these nephrons, it filters the blood and removes urea and salts and urine are left in the kidney"
15407,the urine thus formed by each of the kidney is then passed through the ureter (a tube-like structure which connects the kidney to the bladder) to urinary bladder
15408,"the urine is stored in the urinary bladder for some times and at regular intervals it, is removed through the opening at the end of the tube called urethra"
15409,the opening of urinary bladder is controlled by the ring of muscle called as bladder sphincter
15410,when the bladder becomes full with urine this bladder sphincter opens and allows the urine to flow out
15411,carbon dioxide it is produced as a waste product in our body cells during the process of respiration
15412,the food is broken down during respiration to release energy and releases co2 as a by-product
15413,this co2 is removed from our body by the lungs during exhalation
15414,"therefore, lungs also act as the excretory organs for removing the waste product, co2from the body"
15415,sweat it is the liquid waste of the body that is produced by the sweat glands present in our skin
15416,"sweat contains water, some unwanted salts and urea in a very small amount"
15417,"the two major functions of sweat are as follows : it helps to remove excess water, salt and urea from the body"
15418,it helps to keep our body cool during hot summer days
15419,dialysis the normal functioning of the kidney is necessary for good health of a person
15420,but sometime s the kidney may stop working due to infection or injury
15421,this condition of kidney is called kidney failure which may lead to the accumulation of urea in the blood of a person
15422,"since, urea is a toxic substance which must be removed from the blood"
15423,such person having kidney failure cannot survive unless his blood is filtered periodically through the artificial kidney machine to remove urea
15424,the process used for cleaning the blood of a person by separating the waste product urea from it is called dialysis.this machine removes urea and other waste the product periodically
15425,the long term solution for the patient suffering from kidney failure is kidney transplantation
15426,"in this method, the diseased or damaged kidney is removed and the matching kidney is donated by a healthy person"
15427,the donated kidney is transplanted in its place by performing ^surgery
15428,"excretion in animals like humans, animals also excrete waste products from their body"
15429,the way in which waste materials are removed from the body of the animal depends upon the availability of water
15430,fishes are the aquatic animals that excrete ammonia as their waste product
15431,this ammonia is excreted in the gaseous form which directly gets dissolved in water
15432,"the land animals like lizards, birds, snakes, etc, have less water availability"
15433,these animals excrete this waste material in the form of uric acid pellets
15434,these are white coloured semi-solid excretory products of several land animals
15435,"urea is the excretory product of animals like human, cow, goat, etc"
15436,"amoeba, paramecium, etc., are the unicellular organisms and their excretory products are removed by diffusion from the body of the organism into the surrounding water"
15437,transport of substances in plants plants take up water and dissolved minerals from the soil through their roots and transport it to their leaves
15438,the leaves use this water and mineral for synthesising their food by the process called photosynthesis.the food produced by green plants in transported back to all the parts of plant body
15439,"therefore, it is clear that plants also need a transport system for carrying water, minerals and food through various parts of their body"
15440,transport of water and minerals plant root absorbs the water and mineral from the soil
15441,the roots possess root hair which increase the surface area of the root for absorption of water and minerals nutrient that is dissolved in the water
15442,it is moved from roots up to the stem and leaves through the tube-like tissue called as xylem
15443,absorption and flow of water is a continuous process through the xylem tissue
15444,xylem tissues are the continuous network of channels which connect roots to the leaves through the stem and branches
15445,it thus transports water and minerals to the leaves of the entire plant
15446,transport of food material the food manufactured in the leaf is transported to different parts of plants
15447,this transportation of food material from leaves to the other parts of plants is carried out by the tissue called phloem and the process of transport of food material is called translocation
15448,the phloem consists of vessels that are known as sieve tubes
15449,the xylem and phloem tissues together form the vascular bundles or conducting tissues
15450,transpiration the process of evaporation of water through the stomata present on the surface of leaves is called transpiration
15451,"the continuous evaporation of water from the leaves produces an upward pull, called a suction force"
15452,"this force pulls the water from roots upward through the stem, branches and finally to the leaves"
15453,"though transpiration causes loss of water from the plants, still it is a necessary process for plants due to the following reasons: suction pull caused due to the evaporation of water helps to draw water to a great height in tall trees"
15454,"it produces a cooling effect on the plant and therefore, prevents the plants from the damage caused by heat of sunlight"
15455,it also helps in the transport of water and minerals to the leaves for performing photosynthesis in them
15456,the rate of transpiration increases in a hot sunny day or in moving air
15457,this happens because the heat from sun or moving air causes evaporation of water at a faster rate from the stomata
15458,increases in the rate of transpiration cause an increased rate of absorption of water through the roots
15459,"therefore, when a potted plant is kept under the moving fan, the absorption of water through root will be increased along with the increased rate of evaporation"
15460,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 11 transportation in animals and plants pdf free download will help you

15462,"the organic impurities present in sewage are human faeces, animal wastes (like animal dung), urea (as urine), oil, fruits and vegetable wastes, pesticides, herbicides, etc"
15463,"the inorganic impurities present in sewage are nitrates, phosphates and metals"
15464,the bacteria present in sewage include those bacteria which cause water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid
15465,the other microbes present in sewage are protozoa which cause a water-borne disease called dysentery
15466,"water freshens up: an eventful journey in a house (a public building) generally, there are two sets of pipes, i.e"
15467,one set of pipes brings clean drinking water into the house and the other set of pipes takes away wastewater (sewage) from houses
15468,sewerage system the pipes which carry away wastewater or sewage from houses and other buildings are buried under the ground
15469,an underground pipe which carries away dirty drainage water and waste matter is called sewer
15470,the provision of drainage at a place by laying sewers under the ground is called sewerage
15471,"actually, sewerage is an underground network of interconnected pipes called sewers that carries the sewage from the place where it is produced to the sewage treatment plants, where it is processed"
15472,"manholes a manhole is a covered vertical hole in the ground, pavement or road, above the underground sewer pipeline through which a worker can go down up to the sewer pipes for inspection, cleaning, etc"
15473,manholes are provided at every 50-60 m distance in the main sewer pipeline
15474,manholes are also provided at the junction of two or more sewers and at points where there is a change in the direction of the sewer line
15475,it will help you to understand the processes that take place at the wastewater treatment plant
15476,wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) a place where wastewater or sewage from houses and other buildings is brought for processing is called wastewater treatment plant
15477,"treatment of wastewater involves physical, biological and chemical processes depending on the nature of contaminants"
15478,"physical process (screening) the bar screens first remove the large rubbish objects like rags, sticks, cans, polybags, napkins, sanitary towels, etc., from the wastewater"
15479,"after passing through the bar screen, wastewater is taken to a tank called grit and sand removal tanks"
15480,"in this, sand and grit settle down slowly at the bottom of the tank as water passes slowly through this tank"
15481,the settled sand and impurities are removed from the tanks from time to time
15482,biological process the first sedimentation tank is sloped towards the centre
15483,solid like faeces settle at the bottom and is called sludge which is removed by a scraper
15484,oils and grease float at the surface of the water are removed by a skimmer
15485,the biogas produced (by anaerobic bacteria) in the process can be used as fuel or can be used to produce electricity
15486,"here, water gets cleared of rubbage, oil, grease, etc and we get clarified water which is sent to aeration tank now"
15487,"in the aeration tank, the watery waste already contains bacteria (aerobic) in it"
15488,"the compressed air bubbles are passed through this waste to provide 02 to the bacteria to increase bacterial activity which ultimately digests human waste, food waste, soaps and other unwanted and harmful matter still remaining in the wastewater leaving behind fairly pure water"
15489,chemical process the water after aeration tank is allowed to stand in a second sedimentation tank
15490,"here, the microbes present get settled at the bottom at the tank in the form of activated sludge which is about 97% water"
15491,"at this stage, water has very low level of organic matter suspended matter and does not contain many harmful things"
15492,it is safe for human consumption but is disinfected by chlorine or ozone before distributing it
15493,become an active citizen waste generation is a natural part of human activity but we can limit the type of waste and quantity of waste produced
15494,the situation worsens in the rainy season when the drains start overflowing
15495,we have to wade through the mud pools on the roads
15496,we should be an enlightened citizen and approach the municipality or the gram panchayat
15497,if the sewage of any particular house makes the neighbourhood dirty
15498,we should request them to be more considerate about other’s health
15499,these trees absorb all surplus wastewater rapidly and release pure water vapour into the atmosphere
15500,better house keeping practices we must minimise and manage waste at our houses before its disposal in the following manner: cooking oil and fats should not be thrown down the drain
15501,"in an open drain, the fats clog the soil pores reducing its effectiveness in filtering water"
15502,"used tea leaves, solid food remains, soft toys, cotton, sanitary towels, etc., should also be thrown in the dustbin"
15503,"the chemicals like paints, solvents, insecticides, medicines and motor oils should not be thrown in drains as they kill helpful microbes which digest the organic waste"
15504,sanitation and disease contaminated water and poor sanitation practices are the major causes of the number of infectious diseases in our country
15505,safe sewage disposal facilities are still not available at many cities and villages in india
15506,"this causes the increase in insect-vector population which transmit diseases like cholera, typhoid, meningitis, etc"
15507,untreated human excreta is a health hazard which causes soil pollution and water pollution also
15508,the river water and groundwater are sources of water for drinking for many people
15509,"vermi-processing toilets in the vermi-processing toilets, human excreta is treated by earthworms in a pit"
15510,the earthworms usually eat up all organic matter present in human excrete and turn it into compost
15511,these are tow water use toilets for the safe processing of human
15512,"alternate arrangement for sewage disposal low cost outside the sewage disposal system has been developed to take care of places where there is no sewage system, e.g"
15513,these are described below: (i) septic tanks: septic tank is a low-cost onsite sewage disposal system
15514,"a septic tank usually consists of a big, covered underground tank made of concrete having an inlet pipe at one end and on outlet pipe at the other end"
15515,the toilet seat is connected to the inlet pipe of the septic tank
15516,the human excreta from the toilet seat enters into the septic tank through the inlet pipe
15517,the solid part of excreta keeps on collecting at the bottom of the septic tank in the form of a sludge whereas watery waste remains above it
15518,the anaerobic bacteria breakdown most of the solid organic matter present in human excreta due to which the volume of solid waste is reduced too much
15519,the digested solid waste keeps on depositing at the bottom of septic tank
15520,the excess water goes out of the septic tank through the outlet pipe and get absorbed in soil
15521,(ii) composting pits: these are self-sustained human waste disposal units which is not connected to a sewer line or a septic tank
15522,a composting toilet breaks down and dehydrates human waste to compost
15523,(iii) chemical toilets: these toilets have limited storage capacity for human waste and need to be emptied periodically
15524,these are the toilets which use chemically treated reservoir located just below the toilet seats
15525,the chemicals reduce the foul smell coming out of human excrete and carry out partial disinfection of human waste
15526,"sanitation at public places in our country, fairs are organised periodically"
15527,"in the same way, railway stations, bus depots, airports, hospitals are very busy places"
15528,thousands of people visit them daily which generate large amount of waste
15529,it must be disposed of properly otherwise epidemics could break out
15530,"the government has laid down certain standards of sanitation but unfortunately, they are not strictly enforced"
15531,"if there is no dustbin in sight, we should carry the litter at home and throw it in the dustbin"
15532,conclusion we all have a role to play in keeping our environment clean and healthy
15533,we must realise our responsibility in maintaining the water sources in a healthy state
15534,as an agent of change your individual initiative will make a great difference
15535,"influence others with your energy ideas and optimum, a lot con be done if people work together"
15536,these can be listed as follows: to ensure that our surroundings are clean
15537,to ensure that the sewerage system in our house is properly managed
15538,"if any leakage or an open drain in the sewerage system is present, then it should be reported to the municipality or the gram panchayats to insist that the open drain must be covered properly and several air and water-borne diseases can be prevented"
15539,"note: mahatma gandhi said, ‘no one needs to wait for anyone else to adopt a humane and enlightened course of action’"
15540,we hope the given cbse class 7 science notes chapter 18 waste water story pdf free download will help you

15542,"if a person does not get food, she/he feels weak and is likely to fall ill"
15543,there is a wide range of food items eaten across various states of india
15544,"we eat animals (as meat) as well as their different products like milk, eggs and honey"
15545,cooked food can be easily consumed and absorbed by our body
15546,"domesticated animals are classified as meat yielding, milk yielding and drought animals"
15547,ingredients: materials needed to prepare a dish or food are called its ingredients
15548,edible parts: those parts (of a plant) which are eatable are called edible parts nectar: sweet juices found in flowers are known as nectar
15549,sprouted seeds: seeds which grow white thread like structures when soaked in water are called sprouted seeds
15550,"herbivore: animals which eat plants and plant products like fruits, flowers, seeds, nectar, etc., are called herbivores"
15551,"omnivore: animals which eat both plants and their products, as well as other animals, are called omnivores"
15552,let us see what mrs iyer and mrs kapoor have prepared
15553,list out the six food items that you see on their table
15554,"thus, plant parts and animal products are our sources of food"
15555,vada idli chapathi chicken curry fish curry rice food from plants: green plants are known as producers because they prepare their own food
15556,"they use light, air (carbon dioxide), water, and chlorophyll (present in their leaves) to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis"
15557,"fruits, vegetables, cereals, and pulses that we eat are obtained from different parts of a plant"
15558,"roots of plants like carrot, radish, turnip, sweet potato, and beetroot are eaten (fig"
15559,"for example, the stem of sugarcane plant is eaten and is also used to make sugar"
15560,the stem and flower of the banana plant is cooked and eaten in different parts of india
15561,"leaves of plants like lettuce, spinach, cabbage, coriander, mint, and basil are eaten (fig"
15562,"flowers of certain plants like cauliflower, broccoli, and banana are also eaten (fig"
15563,"seeds pulses like mung bean, kidney bean, chickpea, and cereals (wheat, maize, and rice) that we eat are seeds of plants (fig"
15564,wheat grains are ground to make flour (atta) which is used to make chapattis
15565,"cumin seeds, pepper, and cardamom that we eat as spices are also seeds of different plants"
15566,sprouted seeds (or sprouts) of mung bean and chickpea (bengal gram) are very nutritious
15567,sprouting involves soaking seeds and draining the water and then leaving them till they germinate
15568,fruits and vegetables plants also provide us fruits and vegetables (fig
15569,"like different plant parts, animal too serve as sources of food"
15570,let us learn about the main food products obtained from animals
15571,"food from animal: animal products like meat, egg, honey, milk, cheese, butter, and curd are eaten by human beings"
15572,"meat of animals like goat, chicken, fish, and prawns is commonly eaten (fig"
15573,egg hen’s egg is the most common bird egg eaten in the world
15574,honey: honey is a sweet liquid made by bees from the nectar of flowers (fig
15575,"milk: milk is obtained from animals like cow, buffalo, and goat"
15576,fig’1-8 honev it is a very nutritious food item and is a rich source of proteins
15577,"milk also contains calcium, which is required for proper bone growth and nerve function (fig"
15578,paneer (cottage cheese): common methods of making paneer include adding lemon juice or vinegar to milk
15579,"then, the liquid portion of milk is drained off and the solid part forms paneer"
15580,"cheese: cheese is made from curdled milk of cow, goat, sheep, or buffalo (fig"
15581,cream: cream is made by collecting the top fatty layer of the milk
15582,ghee: ghee is made by gently heating butter and removing the solid matter
15583,curd common methods of making curd include adding a small sample of curd in warm milk
15584,the microorganisms (bacteria) present in the curd sample turn the milk into curd
15585,microorganisms tiny organisms that can be seen only with the help of a microscope let’s remember write two examples for each of the following
15586,roots that we eat stems that we eat leaves that we eat flowers that we eat seeds that we eat what do animals eat: different animals have different feeding habits
15587,"based on their feeding habits, animals can be divided into three groups: herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores"
15588,"1.11) or herbivores (herbi, plant; vore, eater) are those that eat only plants and plant products"

15795,"making measurement of a length: in making measurement of length of an object, we should follow the following procedure: place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in fig"
15796,measurement with a scale with broken ends avoid taking measurements from zero mark
15797,"use any other full mark of the scale, say 1.0 cm"
15798,subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end
15799,"10.3 (6), the reading at starting mark is 1.0 cm and at the other end it is 6.5 cm"
15800,"therefore, the length of the object is (6.5 – 1.0) cm = 5.5 cm"
15801,correct position of the eye is also important for making measurement
15802,your eye must be exactly above the point where the measurement is to be taken as shown in fig
15803,"with the scales of this kind we can measure correctly up to one millimetre, that is one-tenth of a centimetre"
15804,this is called the least count of a (15 cm) scale
15805,measuring the length of a curved line: we cannot measure the length of a curved line directly by using a metre scale

15835,crystallisation: the process of crystallisation is used for obtaining pure crystalline substance from impure sample
15836,decantation: it is the transfer of clean liquid from one vessel to the other without disturbing the settled (sedimented) particles
15837,evaporation: it is the process of removing water (or moisture) from a mixture either by heating on flame or direct sunlight
15838,"for example, salt from sea water is obtained by this method"
15839,filtration: filtration is used to separate solid particles from liquid by passing the mixture through a filter paper
15840,"handpicking: this method is used for separating small particles of dirt, stone, husk, etc., from the grains of wheat, rice, pulses, etc"
15841,loading: it is the process of faster sedimentation by suspending alum to a liquid
15842,sedimentation: it is the process of settling of heavy solid particles in a mixture at the bottom of the vessel
15843,sieving sieving is used when two components of a mixture have different particle sizes
15844,"sieving allows the fine particles to pass through the holes of the sieve, while the bigger particles remain on the sieve"
15845,"for example, sieving of wheat flour, sieving of sand at construction sites"
15846,saturated solution: a solution in which no more soluble substance can be dissolved at room temperature is called saturated solution
15847,"solution: when a soluble substance is dissolved completely in a liquid (say sugar in water), a homogeneous mixture is formed"
15848,threshing: the process that is used to separate grain from stalks is threshing
15849,winnowing: winnowing can be used to separate lighter and heavier components of a mixture
15850,"for example, to separate husk from grain with the help of air"
15851,methods of separation: different methods are used for separating different substances that are mixed together
15852,threshing: grains or seeds of plants like rice and wheat serve as sources of food
15853,the flour (atta) that is used for making chapattis is made from wheat grains
15854,"after these crops have been harvested or cut, the grains need to be separated from the stalks (the dried stems)"
15855,the process of beating harvested crops to separate the grains from the stalks is called threshing
15856,it is done manually (by hand) or with the help of machines
15857,manual threshing is done by holding a pile of crop and beating it on a rock or a hard surface (fig
15858,"sometimes, threshing is also done by crushing the harvested stalks using bullocks"
15859,threshing is also done with the help of machines like the combine harvester (fig
15860,threshed grains may still contain seed coverings and tiny pieces of leaves or stem (collectively called chaff)
15861,winnowing: the method used to separate chaff from the grain by wind or blowing air is called winnowing
15862,the mixture of chaff and grain is taken in a winnowing basket (fig
15863,the farmer stands at a higher level and lets the mixture fall to the ground
15864,"the grain, being heavier, falls almost vertically whereas the lighter chaff is carried away by the wind and forms a separate heap away from the grain"
15865,the direction of the wind plays an important role in the process of winnowing
15866,"hand-picking: rice, wheat, pulses, etc., that we buy from the market may contain impurities (unwanted or harmful particles) in the form of small stones, unwanted grains, etc"
15867,"often, these impurities look very different from the food item and can be spotted easily"
15868,the method of separation used in such a case is hand-picking (fig
15869,"this method is preferred when the quantity of the mixture is small, the unwanted substance is present in smaller quantities, and the size, shape, or colour of the unwanted substance is different from that of the useful one"
15870,"sieving: if the components of a mixture are of different sizes, they can be separated by sieving (fig"
15871,the smaller component passes through the pores of the sieve whereas the larger component (stones or husk) is left behind in it
15872,this method is used in some homes to separate wheat bran (the bigger particles) from flour
15873,"however, sieving wheat flour is not advisable as wheat bran, which is removed during sieving, is very rich in nutrients and is also a rich is better to remove visible impurities by hand picking"
15874,the process of sieving is also used to separate pebbles and stones from sand at construction sites
15875,the stones and pebbles present in the mixture remain in the sieve and the fine sand particles pass through the holes of the sieve
15876,sedimentation and decantation: have you seen pulses being washed in your home
15877,"when pulses are kept in a bowl of water, they settle down as they are heavy"
15878,"however, dirt, insects, tiny pieces of straw, and other lighter impurities float at the top"
15879,"the water, which contains these impurities, is then poured out and discarded"
15880,"the process of separating insoluble solids, suspended in a liquid, by allowing them to settle down is called sedimentation"
15881,the solid particles that settle down during sedimentation are called sediments
15882,the process of pouring out the clear upper liquid without disturbing the sediments is called decantation

15897,"like salt and sugar, dissolve in water and are known as soluble substances"
15898,substances like chalk and sand do not dissolve in water and are known as insoluble substances
15899,the substance that dissolves is called the solute and the substance in which the solute dissolves is called the solvent
15900,"if we keep adding spoonfuls of sugar to water and stir the solution each time, what will happen after some time"
15901,we will notice some grains of sugar at the bottom of the solution
15902,a saturated solution is the solution in which no more of the solute can be dissolved
15903,can we then dissolve that ‘extra’ sugar present in the saturated solution
15904,"yes, we can increase the solubility of a solute by heating the solution"
15905,solubility is the ability of a substance to get dissolved in a given liquid
15906,the quantity of a substance that can dissolve in hot water is much more as compared to that in cold water
15907,there are some other factors that increase the solubility of a solute
15908,stirring we can observe this by taking two glasses of water and adding a spoonful of sugar to each glass
15909,solute in powdered form we can observe this by taking two glasses of water and adding a whole sugar cube in one glass and powdered or crushed sugar cube in the other
15910,different substances dissolve in different amounts of water while making a saturated solution

15914,decantation the process of pouring out the clear upper liquid without disturbing the sediments is called decantation
15915,filtration the process by which an insoluble solid is separated from a liquid by passing the mixture through a filtering device is called filtration
15916,saturated solution a solution that can dissolve no more of the solute is called a saturated solution
15917,threshing is done either manually or by using machines to separate seeds or grains from the stalks
15918,winnowing involves separating the chaff from the grain by letting the mixture fall to the ground from a height when the wind is blowing
15919,sedimentation and decantation are used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid
15920,insoluble solid impurities present in water can be removed by filtration
15921,solubility of a solute can be increased by heating the mixture or it can also be increased by adding the solute in the powdered form

16274,what happens to an ice cream if you do not finish it quickly
16275,can you change the molten ice cream back into a solid
16276,molten ice cream can be changed back to its solid form
16277,"if you take out some ice cubes from the freezer and keep them outside, the ice cubes will absorb heat from the surrounding and melt"
16278,"when this water (molten ice) is heated for some time, it starts boiling (liquid starts to evaporate) and steam escapes from the container [fig"
16279,"now, if you hold a lid over the container, the steam will again liquify or condense into small droplets of water on coming in contact with the cold lid [fig"
16280,this water can be cooled down further and then kept in the freezer to form ice again [fig
16281,"thus, the three physical states of water are reversible and can be changed from one state to another by heating or cooling"

16290,this new substance differs from the paper in its appearance and properties
16291,cooking of food is an irreversible change because we cannot get back the ingredients in their original form after cooking them
16292,"for example, after a cake is baked using flour, egg, milk, chocolate, etc., we cannot get back the ingredients (fig"
16293,burning of a candle is often cited as an example of physical change because what we see immediately is melting of wax that solidifies on cooling
16294,"however, when a candle burns, the wax is undergoing two changes at the same time: first it melts, and then it burns"
16295,"the melted wax burns on the wick – the wick itself isn’t burning, it is just the wax on it"
16296,physical and chemical changes: changes in which no new substances are formed are called physical changes
16297,changes in which new substances with different properties are formed are called chemical changes
16298,"cooking of food, burning of substances are chemical changes as entirely new substances are formed"
16299,burning of a candle wax releases carbon dioxide and water vapour (new substances)
16300,expansion and contraction of materials: some materials expand on heating and some contract on cooling
16301,heating makes the particles (that form the material) expand or become loose

16318,"water can exist in all the three states—solid, liquid and gas"
16319,liquid state: the water that we use in everyday life is a liquid
16320,"gaseous state: we have learnt that on heating, water evaporates to form its vapour"
16321,"these three states of water are interconvertible to each other, that is, we can change it from one state to another"
16322,the easy interconvertibility of water from one state to other makes its availability in all parts of the earth and throughout the year
16323,evaporation the process of changing water to its vapour form is known as evaporation
16324,evaporation takes place from open surfaces of water all the time—day and night
16325,"evaporation of water takes place continuously from oceans, rivers, lakes, wells and soil"
16326,"oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ponds and wells together are often known as water bodies"
16327,"during the day time, sunlight falls on the water in oceans, rivers, lakes"
16328,"the fields, roads, rooftops and other land areas also receive sunlight"
16329,"as a result, water from oceans, rivers, lakes and the soil, and other land areas gets continuously changed into vapour"
16330,"thus, water vapour gets continuously added to air due to evaporation"
16331,transpiration transpiration: it is the loss of water from the leaves of plants in the form of vapour
16332,"every plant, whether it is in a crop field, a forest, on the roadside or in a kitchen garden, transpires to give off water vapour"
16333,the amount of water vapour that goes into air through the process of transpiration is very huge
16334,condensation condensation: the process of conversion of vapour into liquid form of water is called condensation
16335,cloud formation: the climate close to the earth’s surface is warm
16336,"at the upper layer of atmosphere, where the temperature is lower, the vapour gets condensed into tiny water droplets and forms clouds"
16337,it may so happen that many droplets of water come together to form larger sized drops of water
16338,such drops of water may become so heavy that they begin to fall
16339,"rain: if the water during precipitation remains liquid till it reaches the surface of the earth, we have rains"
16340,hail/snow: sometimes precipitation may be in the form of hail or snow
16341,water in a hail or snow is in its frozen or solid form
16342,"dew: many times, especially during winter nights, the air near the surface becomes quite cool"
16343,"as a result, the water vapour present in it condenses to form water droplets"
16344,water back to ocean the water that falls on the land as rain and snow sooner or later goes back to oceans
16345,"uses of water it is needed for drinking, bathing, washing, cleaning of vessels, toilets, flushing, etc"
16346,"water is used in many industries, like paper, rayon, petroleum refining, fertilizers, dyes, drugs and other chemical industries"
16347,water is used in car radiators to keep the engine cool
16348,"sources of water rivers and springs: most of the water which human beings use for drinking, washing and farming comes from rivers and springs"
16349,"the river flows down the mountain side and across the land, finally flowing into a sea or an ocean"
16350,oceans and seas: most of the water on the earth is found in the oceans and seas
16351,"however, the water found in the oceans and seas is not fit for drinking or agricultural purposes as it contains large amount of salt"
16352,"however, ocean acts as a habitat for large number of plants and animals"
16353,snow: some regions of the earth are covered with snow especially during winters
16354,water formed by melting of snow is another source of water
16355,sometimes this water flows down in the form of streams and rivers
16356,groundwater: the ground water is actually rainwater which mainly comes from seepage of water accumulated under the ground
16357,"water table: if you take soil from ground, it has air as well as water"
16358,"as you go down, the amount of water increases and air decreases"
16359,"a level below surface, where it is only water, is called the water table"
16360,these are created by collection of rainwater in low lying areas
16361,seepage from the groundwater reserves also adds to the water in lakes and ponds
16362,rain: the rain is a very important source of water for us
16363,natural calamities the conditions of flooding and drought are called natural calamities
16364,"drought: if it does not rain for a year or more at a place, the soil will lose its water by evaporation and becomes dry"
16365,water will also be lost through transpiration process from the plants
16366,"rivers, ponds and wells will dry and the water table would lower down"
16367,"if it continues for one or two years consecutively, it results into drought"
16368,consequences of drought: the result of drought may be no crops
16369,the overall consequence of such a situation will lead to loss of life of humans and animals
16370,"flood: in case of continuous rains, the water level of rivers, lakes and ponds will rise"
16371,the soil surface will get laden with water resulting into flood
16372,"consequences of flood: when the soil gets too much of water, air in the soil comes out of it"
16373,"due to lack of air, the animals living inside the soil also come out of it"
16374,heavy rainfall also results in the loss of crops due to flood
16375,factors responsible for flood: a number of factors are responsible for flood
16376,"these factors can be intensity and duration of rainfall, soil condition and presence of plants or trees on the ground"
16377,water conservation it is very important that water should be used carefully
16378,it is not necessary that the water used in the garden is fit for drinking
16379,yet most often we water the gardens with drinking water supplied by the corporation
16380,"we should use water for gardening that has already been used in the kitchen for washing vegetables and fruits, etc"
16381,always be careful that the water tank in your house doesn’t overflow when it is being filled
16382,don’t use a hose pipe to wash your car or scooter
16383,"if you leave the tap running while brushing your teeth, about 16 litres of water get used up"
16384,rainwater harvesting water harvesting is the activity of collection of rainwater directly by various means
16385,harvested water can either be used immediately or it can be stored for later use
16386,"in kerala and mizoram, where it rains almost the whole year round, small tanks are used to collect rainwater, which drains from rooftops through pipes into these tanks"
16387,"in a place like delhi where the monsoon lasts only for 3 months, it is more useful to collect rainwater as groundwater"
16388,water vapour: the gaseous form of water is called water vapour
16389,clouds: when water vapour goes up where temperature is low it gets condensed into tiny water droplets and forms clouds
16390,condensation: the process of conversion of vapour into liquid form of water is called condensation
16391,"drought: if it does not rain for one or two years consecutively at a place, it is known as drought"
16392,evaporation: process of conversion of water into water vapour is called evaporation
16393,"flood: in case of continuous rains for long time at a place, it will result into the rise in the water level of rivers, lakes and ponds"
16394,the soil surface will get laden with water resulting into flood
16395,"groundwater: the groundwater is actually rainwater which mainly comes from seepage of water, accumulated under the ground"
16396,"hail: sometimes during precipitation of water droplets, water freezes, and takes the form of hail"
16397,ocean: ocean is the biggest body of water surrounding the globe
16398,rainwater harvesting: rainwater harvesting is the activity of collection of rainwater by various means
16399,snow: it is the condition similar to the formation of hail
16400,water cycle: it is the circulation of water through the process of evaporation and rain or snowfall
16401,water available for use about three-fourth of the earth’s surface is covered with water
16402,but do you know how much water is readily available for use
16403,most of the water (about 97%) is in the seas and oceans as salt water
16404,this water is too salty to be used for drinking and irrigation
16405,"thus, only a tiny fraction (about 3%) of the earth’s water is available to us as freshwater"
16406,"out of this, 2.997% is locked up in the mountains or glaciers or is buried so deep under that it costs too much to extract"
16407,"so, only about 0.003% of the fresh water is easily available to us in the form of groundwater, river, lake, stream, soil moisture, and water vapour"
16408,"uses of water besides being essential for life, water is used for many other purposes"
16409,"in india, about 70% of the total water available is used for agriculture, 20-22% by industries and only 8% is used for personal or domestic needs"
16410,figure 15.2 shows a pie chart that gives the percentage use of water
16411,"farmers rely on water to sustain their agricultural crops, e.g., wheat, paddy, etc"
16412,"many times, rainfall is not sufficient to water these crops, and farmers have to use artificial watering systems, referred to as irrigation"
16413,"industrial needs factories use a large amount of water every day—as raw material, for cleaning, heating, cooling, generating electricity (e.g., water turbines), etc"
16414,"the amount of required depends on the kind and size of the factory, and water"
16415,"we also need water to bathe, wash clothes and dishes, clean our house, and to water plants"
16416,"apart from these uses, water is also used for transportation and recreation (fig"
16417,it also regulates the climate of a place and provides homes to many animals
16418,"different states of water in nature, water exists in three states"
16419,"it could be in the form of liquid (e.g., rain, river, sea), solid (e.g., ice, snow, hail), or gas (e.g., water vapour) (fig"
16420,you can heat water over a stove to convert it into vapour
16421,what happens if you leave water in an uncovered vessel on a summer afternoon outside your house
16422,"after a few hours, you will find that the level of water in the vessel has decreased"
16423,this is because a lot of it would have escaped into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour
16424,the process by which a liquid is converted to its vapour is called evaporation
16425,the process by which the vapour of a substance is converted to its liquidform is called condensation
16426,"water vapour is also added into the air by the leaves of plants, through the process of transpiration"
16427,evaporation and condensation of water take place on a very large scale on the surface of the earth and its atmosphere
16428,these processes play a key role in cloud formation and rain
16429,"cloud formation when the temperature of air increases, it expands (i.e., its particles move away from one another)"
16430,"this makes the air lighter and it rises in the atmosphere, taking water vapour with it"
16431,the water vapour condenses on dust particles present in the atmosphere to form millions of tiny droplets
16432,tiny ice crystals will be formed instead if it is very cold
16433,this cluster of tiny water droplets floating in the air is what we call a cloud
16434,water cycle water droplets in the clouds keep bumping against one another and sometimes stick to form bigger drops
16435,"when these drops become too heavy to float in the air, they drop down back to the earth as rain"
16436,"the water that comes down as rain, in time, evaporates and goes up to form clouds again"
16437,"this leads to forming a cycle, known as the water cycle"
16438,the water cycle is the cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes
16439,"evaporation sun’s heat changes the water in oceans, rivers, ponds, and other water bodies into water vapour"
16440,condensation water vapour rises up and condenses on dust particles to form clouds
16441,"precipitation water stored in clouds reaches earth in the form of rain, snow, etc"
16442,rainwater also flows into streams and rivers and then finds its way into seas and oceans
16443,"drought sometimes it does not rain for a long time—for an entire month, two months, the whole season, two years, etc"
16444,the abnormally long period of insufficient or no rainfall at all is called drought
16445,"during drought, rivers run dry, the water level in lakes goes down, and even the water in the soil dries up (fig"
16446,there is very little or no water available during a drought
16447,most plants die leading to a lack of food in the region
16448,the lack of food in a region for a long period is called famine
16449,"when there are no plants, animals that survive on plants also die"
16450,animals and humans also die due to thirst and dehydration (excessive loss of water from the body)
16451,"flood just as too little rain is bad, too much rain is bad as well"
16452,"it leads to water being everywhere, sometimes the entire area remains under water or submerged"
16453,"a condition when the ground becomes submerged under water, due to heavy rain and overflowing of rivers is called flood"
16454,"during a flood, plants and crops die either due to suffocation by excess water or due to the soil being washed away, robbing their roots of support"
16455,"in such waterlogged conditions, many disease-causing germs start multiplying and cause water-borne diseases"
16456,sometimes water-borne diseases affect thousands of people at the same time
16457,a disease affecting thousands of people at the same time is called an epidemic
16458,"a flood can thus lead to many conditions—disease, starvation, loss of life, and property"
16459,a flood also can have the same effect on the food chain as a drought does
16460,both drought and flood are natural disasters—unfortunate events brought about by nature—that can have a very strong effect on the lives of people
16461,the economy of a country can crumble as a result of the loss of property and life and many more things
16462,but we can and must try to reduce the bad effects of these disasters as much as possible
16463,"we must understand that such things can happen, and so we must be prepared to face them as and when they happen"
16464,"conservation of water since only a small percentage of water on our planet is usable, it is very important that we use water carefully"
16465,"conservation of water can be done by building dams, avoiding wastage of water at homes, both indoors and outdoors, harvesting rainwater, and preventing pollution of water"
16466,"building dam a dam is a structure built to hold back water in order to prevent floods, and to provide water for irrigation and storage"
16467,building a dam is a solution to both drought and flood (fig
16468,"built on rivers, a dam has high walls and has many openings or gates to both let in and hold back water"
16469,"during heavy rainfall, when the rivers fill up, water enters the dam"
16470,"when water is needed later, the gates are opened to let out water"
16471,avoiding wastage at homes some ways to avoid wastage of water at homes are given below
16472,rainwater harvesting: the process of collecting and storing rainwater from roofs or a surface catchment is called rainwater harvesting (fig
16473,"storing rainwater that collects on roofs instead of letting it go down the drain, is a practical solution in case of droughts"
16474,"this involves collecting rainwater from rooftops in dugout ponds, vessels, or underground tanks to store water for long periods"
16475,another option is to allow water to go into the ground directly from the roadside drains that collect rainwater
16476,"the stored rainwater is treated before use because it may contain bird faeces, chemicals, and other pollutants, which need to be removed before use"
16477,preventing water pollution: another method to conserve water is to safeguard our freshwater bodies from pollution
16478,garbage and harmful chemicals pollute the water and make it unfit for use
16479,plants and animals in and around polluted water may die or get infected
16480,"and when human beings consume contaminated fish, etc., they are also put at risk of diseases"
16481,"saltwater: water of the seas and oceans that has high salt content, making it unfit for drinking and irrigation, is called salt water"

16492,only a tiny fraction of the earth’s water is available as fresh water
16493,all living things have a lot of water in their body
16494,"we need water for many purposes—drinking, personal needs, agricultural needs, industrial needs, for transportation and recreation, and regulating the climate"
16495,the water cycle is the cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes
16496,the abnormally long period of insufficient or no rainfall is known as drought

16504,the other is connected to the metal tip of the base
16505,the base of the bulb and the metal tip of the base are the two terminals of the bulb
16506,these two terminals are fixed in such a way that they do not touch each other
16507,"the inside portion of the bulb is filled up with inert gases, like argon"
16508,"circuit: the complete path, from one terminal of the electric cell through the bulb and back to the other terminal of the electric cell, is called a circuit"
16509,"open circuit: if there is any gap in the path of a circuit, the bulb does not light up"
16510,"closed circuit: the bulb lights up only when a bulb and wire form a complete path, which starts at one terminal of electric cell and ends at the other terminal"
16511,"flow of current in a circuit: as soon as the path from one terminal of electric cell to the other is completed, an electric current starts flowing through the circuit and the bulb lights up"
16512,the electric current flows from the positive terminal of the electric cell to its negative terminal
16513,"in the bulb, current enters through one of its terminals, flows through the filament inside the bulb and comes out through the other terminal of the bulb"
16514,"fused bulb: if the filament of the bulb is broken, the circuit is not corhpleted and hence the current cannot flow"
16515,electric switch: electric switch is a simple device that either breaks the circuit or completes it to stop or start the flow of current
16516,"when the switch completes the circuit, it is called closed switch"
16517,"when the switch breaks the circuit, it is called open switch"

16521,filament: the thin wire that gives off light is called the filament of the bulb
16522,it generates direct current (dc) due to chemical reaction that takes place inside it
16523,"bulb: an electric bulb is a device which glows and emits light, when electric current is passed through it"
16524,conductors: materials that allow electric current to pass through them are called conductors
16525,electric circuit: the complete path from one terminal of the electric cell through the bulb and back to other terminal of the electric cell is called an electric circuit

16535,"with help from an adult, look at what is inside a transparent electric bulb (fig"
16536,"among other things, you will see that it has a thin filament (a very thin metal wire)"
16537,the filament heats up when an electric current is passed through it
16538,it heats up so much that it begins to glow and give out light
16539,source of electric current a device that can be used to produce an electric current is called a source of electric current
16540,common sources of electric current are cells and batteries (collection of cells) which comes in various shapes and sizes (fig
16541,"14.2), and electric current that we get from plug points in houses"
16542,a very useful kind of cell which we use very often is the dry cell
16543,"due to a chemical reaction that takes place in cells and batteries, electric current is produced"
16544,"for large-scale production of electricity, flowing water or steam is used"
16545,the dry cell: a dry cell is a very convenient source of electric current
16546,"the dry cell, as its name suggests, contains dry or semi-solid ingredients"
16547,the dry cell contains a paste of ammonium chloride inside a zinc container
16548,"inside the paste, a cardboard container containing powdered manganese dioxide and carbon is placed"
16549,the cardboard container has microscopic ‘holes’ in it (such materials are called porous materials) through which a chemical reaction takes place between ammonium chloride paste and powdered manganese dioxide
16550,"a rod, usually carbon, with a metal cap is dipped into the manganese dioxide"
16551,"the whole thing is then sealed (with only the metal cap sticking out), so that the contents do not spill out"
16552,the zinc can is also wrapped so that only the base is exposed
16553,every source of electric current has two ends or terminals where conducting wires are connected to draw electric current
16554,"the tip of the metal cap and the base of the zinc can are called the positive and negative terminals of the dry cell, respectively"
16555,electric current can be thought of as ‘flowing in’ from one terminal and ‘flowing out’ from the other
16556,"if the tip of the metal cap and the base of the zinc can are connected by a metal wire, current will flow through it"
16557,"different types of electric cells: apart from the simple primary cells like dry cell, there are different types of electric cells"
16558,"primary cells can be used only once, and have to be thrown away once they have been used up"
16559,there are cells that can be recharged once they are drained
16560,solar panels made up of solar cells are used to light up streets and many homes
16561,"a device used to produce an electric current like cell, battery, or a plug point acting as a source"
16562,"a wire made of a metal like copper, silver, or aluminium, which will allow electric current to flow through easily"
16563,"an unbroken loop (of the wire) running from one terminal of the source, through various appliances, back to the other terminal of the source"
16564,"making a simple electric circuit: when we connect the terminals of a pencil cell (name given to the cell due to its shape) to a bulb using two wires, the bulb glows"
16565,this happens because we provide a path for the current to flow
16566,a path for an electric current to flow is called an electric circuit
16567,"in figure 14.6(a), one wire from the pencil cell is connected to the torch bulb, while the other wire is not"
16568,"in figure 14.6(b), both the wires from the cell are connected to the torch bulb"
16569,"electric current flows only if there is an unbroken path or closed circuit starting from one terminal of the source, through the torch bulb, to the other terminal of the source"
16570,"thus, the bulb glows in figure 14.6(b) but not in figure 14.6(a)"
16571,"hence, current cannot flow through the circuit and the bulb does not glow"
16572,"electric current flows through the circuit and, as a result, the bulb glows"

16578,"14.9(a)], and when we close an electric circuit, an electric current flows through it [fig"
16579,electric torch a schematic diagram of an electric torch is shown in fig
16580,"an electric torch has one or more dry cells inside it, which act as the ‘source’"
16581,these cells are connected through a switch to a small bulb
16582,"when the switch is pushed to the ‘on’ position, the circuit is complete and the bulb glows"
16583,"when the switch is pushed to the ‘off’ position, the circuit is incomplete (broken)"
16584,"now the current cannot flow through the circuit, and the light goes out"
16585,then why is it that the bulb glows only in circuits (b) and (d)
16586,it is because not all materials allow electric current to pass through them
16587,a material that allows electric current to pass through it is called a conductor of electricity like the key and the safety pin [figs
16588,a material that does not allow electric current to pass through it is called an insulator of electricity like the rubber band and the plastic pen [figs

16640,"poles of a magnet when magnetic materials (like iron filings) are brought close to a magnet, they do not stick evenly to all parts of the magnet"
16641,"for example, the two ends of a bar magnet are its poles"
16642,"there are two types of poles in every magnet, irrespective of its shape"
16643,"these are, by convention, called the north pole (n) and the south pole (s) (fig"
16644,"if we break a bar magnet in the middle, we would get two pieces, each having a north pole and a south pole"

16653,figure 12.3 shows how one can find directions using a magnetic compass
16654,do you know why a freely suspended magnet always points in the earth’s north-south direction
16655,it behaves like it is under the influence of another magnet
16656,"this alignment happens because of the influence of the earth, which itself acts like a giant bar magnet (fig"
16657,it influences all the magnets (within its region of influence) to align themselves along its north-south direction
16658,"attraction and repulsion when two magnets are brought close to each other, they are either pulled towards each other, or pushed away from each other"
16659,"when the magnets are pulled towards each other, they are said to attract each other"
16660,"when they are pushed away from each other, they are said to repel each other"
16661,whether the magnets attract or repel depends on which poles of the magnets are facing each other

16688,all the opaque objects seem to form a dark shadow of their own
16689,"we need a source of light, an opaque object in the way, and a screen to see a shadow"
16690,screen: this is a surface on which the shadow is formed
16691,the colour of the opaque object does not affect the colour of the shadow
16692,"all the space behind the opaque object, up to some distance behind it seems to be filled with the shadow"
16693,image formed by a pinhole camera images formed by a pinhole camera are upside down
16694,here is a picture showing the path of rays of light coming from an object far away to a pinhole and then to screen
16695,"when sunlight passes through the leaves of a tree, the gaps between the leaves act as the pinholes"
16696,image formation by a plane mirror: we are able to see images through a mirror
16697,image formed by a mirror (flat) has following features: reflected image retains the colour of the object
16698,lateral inversion: right side of the object appears as left side in the image formed by a plane mirror
16699,"for example, if we show our right hand, image in the mirror will show as left hand"
16700,"in a mirror, if you see another person, surely the other person can also see you in that mirror"
16701,luminous: objects that give out or emit light of their own are called luminous objects

16729,the following three things are required for a shadow to form (fig
16730,13.4): a source of light an opaque object a screen or irface behind the object
16731,a shadow will not form if any of these is absent
16732,this explains why we cannot see a shadow in the dark
16733,it is only when light rays are obstructed by an opaque object that we get a shadow of the object
16734,let us perform an activity to learn about the characteristics of a shadow
16735,"characteristics of a shadow: a shadow has the following three characteristics: it is always black, regardless of the colour of the object used to make the shadow it only shows the shape or outline of the object and not the details"
16736,"the size of a shadow varies depending on the distance between the object and the source of light, and the distance between the object and the screen"
16737,reflection surfaces we say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface
16738,reflection of light helps us to see most of the things around us
16739,reflection of light by a surface depends on the nature of the surface
16740,a rough and bumpy surface (also called an irregular surface) reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in different directions (fig
16741,a good example of a rough surface is bark of a tree and blanket
16742,a smooth surface (a highly polished surface) reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in one direction
16743,"when you stand in front of a mirror, you can see yourself in the mirror"
16744,a very interesting phenomenon occurs when an object forms an image by reflection
16745,this is something all of us must have noticed while seeing ourselves in the mirror
16746,"when we lift our right hand, the image in the mirror appears to lift its left hand"
16747,some of the differences between an image and a shadow are given in table 13.1
16748,a pin-hole camera : a pin-hole camera is just a box (fig
16749,13.7) with a very tiny hole on one of its sides
16750,"light falls on the hole, and an inverted image is formed on the side opposite to the hole"
16751,source of light: an object that gives out light (luminous object) is called a source of light
16752,transparent material: a material that transmits all the light is called a transparent material
16753,translucent material: a material that transmits some amount of light is called a translucent material
16754,opaque material: a material that completely blocks the light is called an opaque material
16755,shadow: an area of darkness formed by an opaque object obstructing light is called a shadow
16756,"objects can be transparent, translucent, or opaque, depending on how much light can pass through them"
16757,a shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks the light falling on it
16758,a shadow is always black regardless of the colour of the object
16759,we say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface
16760,"an image shows the colour, outline, and details of the object"
16761,"we hope the given cbse class 6 science notes chapter 11 light, shadows and reflection pdf free download will help you"
16762,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 6 science notes chapter 11 light, shadows and reflection, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
16763,garbage: all the used or unusable substances which cannot be reused in the same form is called garbage
16764,recycling: it is a process in which a material which has been used once is recycled to produce something to reuse
16765,"segregation of wastes garbage or waste may be in the form of fruit or vegetable peels, discarded objects, wrapping materials, wasted food as household garbage, or discarded chemicals and fertilizers washed into rivers, domestic sewage, etc"
16766,wastes that rot (undergo degradation) by the action of decomposers (tiny organisms found in the soil) are called biodegradable wastes
16767,"dead plants and animals and their products (e.g., fruit and vegetable peels, paper, and leaves) decay very easily these wastes mix with the soil and produce manure"
16768,wastes that do not rot by the action of decomposers are called non-biodegradable wastes
16769,"depending on the type of wastes, two garbage bins—one for biodegradable wastes and other for non-biodegradable wastes should be used"
16770,this will help in easy sorting and recycling of wastes to make beneficial products
16771,best out of waste the rock garden in chandigarh is an excellent example of how solid wastes can be utilized
16772,"every item in this garden is made from waste materials like tyres, plastic bottles, eggshells, and tube lights"
16773,this innovative idea of utilizing solid waste has made the rock garden very popular tourist attraction
16774,"management of biodegradable wastes some of the ways to manage biodegradable wastes are as follows: composting: since biodegradable or organic wastes like vegetable peels, waste food, leaves, dead flowers, and egg shells can be recycled, they are converted into manure by burying them in compost pits"
16775,"recycling of organic wastes like vegetable peels, waste food, leaves, etc., by burying them in compost pits is called composting"
16776,the biodegradable wastes are degraded by the action of small organisms like bacteria and fungi
16777,there is also a different kind of composting where a kind of earthworm called red worms (or red wrigglers) act on wastes and degrade them
16778,"this type of composting with the help of a type of earthworm called red worms, is called vermicomposting (fig"
16779,red worms break down the organic matter into nutrient-rich manure which increases soil fertility
16780,vermicompost can be made in 3-4 weeks and it appears as loose soil-like material
16781,one should not put animal product or oily substance in the pit as it could lead to the growth of disease-causing organisms
16782,"the landfill is another method to manage a huge amount, of biodegradable waste"
16783,"in a landfill, garbage is buried in such a way that it does not damage the environment (fig"
16784,garbage buried inside landfills stay here for a long time as it decomposes very slowly
16785,"after a landfill is full, it can be converted into a park"
16786,"for example, indraprastha park in new delhi is built on a landfill site"
16787,"management of non-biodegradable wastes as non-biodegradable wastes like plastic bags, glass bottles, etc., cannot be broken down by decomposers, their disposal poses a big problem"
16788,"non-biodegradable wastes can be managed by practising the concept of 3 rs—reduce, reuse, and recycle"
16789,reduce we need to reduce the amount of waste generated by consuming more and throwing away less
16790,"nowadays, disposable items have become popular, for example, ballpoint pen, plastic bag, disposable napkins etc"
16791,we are using them frequently without giving a thought to their hazardous effects
16792,"here are some tips for reducing wastes: use a fountain pen in place of a ballpoint pen, use old newspapers for packaging, and use cloth napkins in place of disposable ones"
16793,reuse we can reuse certain things for more than one purpose
16794,"if we reuse them for other purposes, we can help in reducing waste"
16795,here are some of the tips for reusing things: small jars and bottles can be cleaned to keep some other kitchen stuff
16796,one should prefer glass bottle to metal can when buying juice or soft drink
16797,"old clothes can be made into other usable items like cushion cover, handkerchief, etc"
16798,recycle the process by which waste materials are used to make new products is called recycling
16799,"materials like glass, metal, plastic, and paper are collected, separated, and recycled to make new things"
16800,"recycling of plastics bucket, bottle, toy, shoe, bag, pen, and comb are a few things made of plastic"
16801,use of plastics has become a major concern nowadays because they are non-biodegradable and release harmful gases upon heating or burning
16802,"therefore, one should reduce and reuse plastic items as far as possible"
16803,"when plastic items are to be discarded, they should be recycled to make new things"
16804,"not all the plastics generated are recycled, hence causing much damage to life on earth"
16805,"in many places in india, plastics are totally banned seeing its adverse effects on the environment"
16806,"some of the ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastics are as follows: paper, cotton, and jute bag should be preferred over plastic bags (fig"
16807,some disposable plastic containers and jars can be used to grow plants (fig
16808,empty bottles can be refilled for storage of water or any other liquid stuff
16809,think about the number of times you buy a bottle of water when you are out
16810,"instead, you can fill the used bottle and carry it whenever you are out"
16811,zip foils can be reused after cleaning thoroughly each time after storing foodstuffs
16812,recycling of paper: paper is made from trees and trees are essential for our survival on earth
16813,"so, even if paper is biodegradable, depletion of trees at a fast pace is a big concern"
16814,some of the ways to save paper are: we should always write on both sides of paper sheets
16815,unused pages from old notebooks can be torn off and made into a new notebook for doing rough work and other miscellaneous work
16816,we can also reuse envelopes and covers by using stickers to write new addresses
16817,"but, by following the 3rs concept, we can manage the garbage generated in our surroundings so that it is beneficial to the environment"
16818,biodegradable wastes: wastes that rot by the action of decomposers are called biodegradable wastes
16819,non-biodegradable wastes: wastes that do not rot by the action of decomposers are called non-biodegradable wastes
16820,"composting: recycling of organic wastes like vegetable peels, waste food, leaves, etc., by burying them in compost pits is called composting"
16821,"vermicomposting: composting with the help of a type of earthworm, called red worms, is called vermicomposting"
16822,recycling: the process by which waste materials are used to make new products is called recycling
16823,there are mainly two types of wastes based on their ability to rot over a period of time: biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes
16824,dead plants and animals and their products decay while objects like plastic and glass do not
16825,"by practising the concept of 3rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle), we can manage our wastes well"

16828,it fills all the space in a container which is otherwise empty and seems to be empty
16829,all living organisms require air for their survival because it contains o2 (oxygen gas) and co2 (carbon dioxide gas) as parts of its mixture
16830,smoke: these are the dark-coloured gases caused by burning of anything
16831,weathercock: it shows the direction in which the air is moving at that place
16832,composition of air air is not one substance but is a mixture
16833,"air is a mixture of some gases, water vapour and dust particles"
16834,"the gases in the air are mainly nitrogen, oxygen, a small amount of carbon dioxide and some other gases"
16835,"when air comes in contact with a cool surface, it gets cooled and fog appears"
16836,the presence of water vapour in the air is important for the water cycle in nature
16837,the presence of dust particles in air varies from place to place and time to time
16838,oxygen the component of air that supports burning is called oxygen
16839,it takes up four-fifth of the space (be around 78.11%) that air fills
16840,carbon dioxide carbon dioxide makes up a small component (0.03%) of air around us
16841,"all materials, when they burn consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide"
16842,atmosphere our earth is surrounded by air in the form of a thin layer
16843,the air becomes thinner and thinner as we go high up from the surface of the earth
16844,"the atmosphere is quite active due to the movement of air, with respect to the earth"
16845,"the processes like cloud formation, thundering, rain etc., occur in the atmosphere"
16846,uses of air uses of air air exerts force on objects that come in its way
16847,"fun like firkins, pinwheel is based on the force applied by air"
16848,"air helps in the movements of sailing yachts, sliders, parachutes and aircraft"
16849,air also helps in dispersal of seeds and pollens of flowers
16850,atmosphere: the envelope of air that surrounds the earth is known as the atmosphere
16851,"composition of air: air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and a few other gases"
16852,smoke: these are the dark-coloured mixture of gases produced due to the burning of anything

16854,it is used to draw water from tube wells and to run flour mills
16855,"air is all around us a thick blanket of air, called the atmosphere, surrounds our earth"
16856,air is also present in things which seem to be empty
16857,"it also contains carbon dioxide, noble gases, water vapour, dust particles, and traces of other gases"
16858,let us now verify the presence of some constituents of air
16859,nitrogen and oxygen : air contains about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen
16860,plants and animals take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide during respiration
16861,water vapour: air contains varying amounts of water vapour depending on the weather of a place
16862,the sun heats up the water in the seas and oceans
16863,you can verify the presence of water vapour in air by observing wet clothes drying on a clothesline (fig
16864,the water from the wet clothes forms water vapour and mixes with the air
16865,dust and smoke: have you seen sun rays entering a dark room
16866,air contains oxygen and carbon dioxide useful to plants and animals
16867,plants use carbon dioxide of the air to make their own food by a process called photosynthesis
16868,let us see how air supports life in plants and animals
16869,"in plants: plants have tiny pores called stomata, found on the underside of a leaf (fig"
16870,air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen enters the plant through these openings where it gets used in photosynthesis and respiration
16871,"in animals: all animals need to respire, be it a cockroach, a fish, or an elephant"
16872,it is just that they use different organs and mechanisms for respiration
16873,"sometimes, we wrongly use the terms of breathing and respiration interchangeably"
16874,"breathing is a physical act of taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide, whereas respiration is a chemical process by which glucose in the body breaks down to give energy"
16875,"in aquatic animals and plants: most aquatic animals like fish, tadpole, crab, and shrimp have special organs for respiration called gills"
16876,gills help to take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide
16877,"some aquatic animals like dolphin and whale come to the surface of the water regularly to take in air, since they breathe with the help of the lungs"
16878,aquatic plants like hydrilla also breathe in oxygen dissolved in water through their stomata
16879,"in amphibians: amphibians like frog, newt, and salamander need breathing systems for both air and water"
16880,crocodile and alligator swim through water with part of their snout above the water surface to breathe easily through nostrils
16881,in birds: birds have an efficient respiratory system as they need high levels of oxygen during flight
16882,"birds have a pair of lungs with air sacs that remain open all the time, so that air can easily pass through them"
16883,balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through respiration in plants and animals and by photosynthesis in plants
16884,"they produce much more oxygen during photosynthesis than they consume, during respiration this is how the oxygen consumed by plants and to a large extent by animals is replenished in the air through photosynthesis"
16885,air pollution the addition of substances in the environment in quantities that are harmful to live beings is called pollution
16886,air is getting polluted day by day because of various human activities
16887,"burning of fuels like coal and petroleum, excessive burning of fuels like wood, smoke and harmful gases released from industries (fig"

16890,"air pollution has major adverse effects on plants, animals as well as human beings"
16891,air pollution also leads to a lot of lung disease like asthma and lung cancer
16892,"if we do not start looking after the quality of air around us, the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels will no longer be balanced and living beings will be the ones getting affected"
16893,there are a number of ways by which we can reduce air pollution
16894,"some of them are: planting more and more trees, recycling plastics, regular checking of vehicles for the emission of harmful gases, etc"
16895,atmosphere: a thick blanket of air pollution the addition of substances in the surrounding the earth’s surface is called the environment in quantities that are the harmful atmosphere

18474,the government was not able to generate sufficient funds from internal sources such as taxation
18475,"expenditure on areas like social sector and defence do not provide immediate returns, so there was a need to utilise the rest of its revenue in a highly effective manner, which the government failed to do"
18476,the income from public sector undertakings was also not very high to meet the growing expenditures
18477,foreign exchange borrowed from other countries and international financial institutions was spent on meeting consumption needs and to make repayments on other loans
18478,no effort was made to reduce such increased spending and sufficient attention was not given to boost exports to pay for die growing needs
18479,"due to above stated reasons, in the late 1980s, government expenditure began to exceed its revenue by such large margins that meeting the expenditure through borrowings became unsustainable"
18480,need for economic reforms the economic policy followed by the government upto 1990 failed in many aspects and landed the country in an unprecedented economic crisis
18481,the situation was so alarming that india’s reserves of foreign exchange were basely enough to pay for two weeks of imports
18482,new loans were not available and nris were withdrawing large amounts
18483,there was an erosion of confidence of international investors in the indian economy
18484,the following points highlight the need for economic reforms in the country increasing fiscal deficit adverse balance of payments gulf crisis rise in prices poor performance of public sector units (psus)

18497,economic reforms under liberalisation reforms under liberalisation were introduced in many areas
18498,"let us discuss these now industrial sector reforms the following steps were taken to deregulate the industrial sector (i) abolition of industrial licensing government abolished the licensing requirement of all industries, except for the five industries, which are liquor cigarettes defence equipment industrial explosives dangerous chemicals, chugs and pharmaceuticals"
18499,(ii) contraction of public sector the number of industries reserved for the public sector was reduced from 17 to 8.

18514,world trade organisation (wto) the wto was founded in 1995 as the successor organisation to the general agreement on trade and tariff (gatt)
18515,gatt was established in 1948 with 23 countries as the global trade organisation to administer all multinational trade agreements by providing equal opportunities to all countries in international market for trading purpose
18516,wto was expected to establish a rule based trading regime in which nations cannot place arbitrary restrictions on trade
18517,its purpose was mainly to expand production and trade in order to have optimum utilisation of world resources
18518,the wto agreements cover {rade in goods as well as services to facilitate international trade through removal of tariff as well as non-tariff barriers and provide better market access to all countries
18519,india has been in front to frame rule and regulations and safeguards interest of developing world
18520,india has kept commitments towards liberalisation of trade in wto by removing quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates
18521,"functions of wto it facilitates the implementation, administration and operation of the objectives of multilateral trade agreements"
18522,"it administers the ‘understanding rules and procedures , governing the settlement disputes’"

18524,trade disputes that cannot be solved through bilateral talks are forwarded to the wto dispute settlement ‘court’
18525,its economist keep a close watch on the activities of the global economy and provide studies on the main issues of the day
18526,privatisation it refers to giving greater role to private sector thereby reducing the role of public sector

18528,it may also mean de-reservation of industries previously reserved for public sector
18529,government companies (public companies) are converted into private companies in two ways by withdrawal of the government from ownership and management of the public sector companies
18530,"forms of privatisation different forms of privatisation are denationalisation when 100% govermffdht ownership of productive assets is transferred to the private sector, it is called denationalisation"
18531,"partial privatisation when less than 100% or more than 50% ownership is transferred, it is a case of partial privatisation with private sector owning majority of shares"
18532,"in this situation, the private sector can claim to possess substantial autonomy in its functioning"
18533,"deficit privatikation/token privatisation when the government disinvests its shares to the extent of 5 to 10% to meet the deficit in the budget, this is termed as deficit privatisation or token privatisation"

18538,"in 2011, about 90 public enterprises were designated with different status"
18539,globalisation is a complex phenomenon and an outcome of the set of various policies that are aimed at transforming the world towards greater interdependence and integration
18540,globalisation attempts to establish links in such a way that the happenings in india can be in need by events happening miles away
18541,it is turning the into one whole or creating a borderless world
18542,outsourcing an outcome of globalisation this is one of the important outcome of the globalisauon process
18543,"in outsourcing, a company hires regular service from external sources, mosdy from other countries, which were previously provided internally or from within the country like legal advice, computer service, advertisement, etc"
18544,in other words outsourcing means getting a work done on contract from someone outside

18546,"many of the services such as voice-based business processes (popularly known as bpo or call centres), record keeping, accountancy, banking services, music recording, film editing, book transcription, clinical advice or even teaching are being outsourced by companies in developed countries to india"
18547,"most multinational corporations and even small companies, are outsourcing their services to india where they can be availed at a cheaper cost with reasonable degree of skill and accuracy"
18548,the low wage rates and availability of skilled manpower in india have made it a destination for global outsourcing in the post reform period
18549,economic growth during reforms growth of an economy is measured by the gross domestic product (gdp)
18550,the growth of gdp increased from 5.6% during 1980-91 to 8.2% during 2007-2012
18551,"main highlights of economic growth during reforms are given below during the reform period, the growth of agriculture has declined"
18552,"while the industrial sector reported fluctuation, the growth of service sector has gone up"
18553,this indicates that the growth is mainly driven by the growth in the service sector
18554,the opening up of the economy has led to rapid increase in foreign direct investment and foreign exchange reserves
18555,"the foreign investment, whiclyincludes foreign – direct investment (fdi) and foreign institutional  investment(fii), has increased from about us $ 100 million in 1990-91 to us $ 400 billion in 2010-11"

18557,"in 2011, india is the seventh largest foreign exchange reserve holder in the world"
18558,"india is seen as a successful exporter of auto parts, engineering goods, it software and textiles in the reform period"
18559,failures of economic reforms i- neglect of agriculture there has been deterioration in agricultural growth rate
18560,this deterioration is the root cause of the problem of rural distress that reached crisis in some parts of the country
18561,"economic reforms have not been able to benefit the agricultural sector because public investment in agriculture sector especially in infrastructure which includes irrigation, power, roads, market linkages and research and extension has been reduced in the reform period"
18562,the removal of fertiliser subsidy has led to increase in the cost of production which has severely affected the small and marginal formers
18563,"various policy changes like reduction in import duties on agricultural products, removal of minimum support price and lifting of quantitative restrictions have increased the threat of* international competition to the indian formers"
18564,export-oriented policy strategies in agriculture has been a shift from production for the domestic market towards production for the export market focusing on cash crops in lieu of production of food grains
18565,ii- uneven growth in industrial sector industrial sector registered uneven growth during this period
18566,this is because of decreasing demand of industrial products due to various reasons cheaper imports have decreased the demand for domestic industrial goods
18567,globalisation created conditions for the free movement of goods and services from foreign countries that adversely affected the local industries and employment opportunities in developing countries
18568,there was inadequate investment in infrastructural facilities such as power supply
18569,a developing country like india still does not have the access to developed countries markets because of high non-tariff barriers
18570,"sirdlla tragedy privatisation of power supply in andhra pradesh resulted in substantial increase in power-rates, causing many powerlooms to shut down in a small town, sirdlla"
18571,50 workers committed suicide because of loss in means of livelihood
18572,"ii- other failures in addition to the above mentioned failures, the other drawbacks of lpg policy were: it led to urban concentration of growth process"
18573,low level of productivity high degree of vulnerability a wedge between owners of the soil and tillers of the soil
18574,factors causing backwardness and stagnation of indian agriculture during the british rule land revenue settlement under the british raj forced commercialisation of agriculture industrial sector “systematic de-industrialisation” is the term that describes the status of industrial sector during the british rule
18575,it implied two things decay of world famous traditional handicraft industry owing to discriminatory policies of the british government
18576,bleak growth of modern industry now to lack of investment opportunities
18577,two-fold motive behind the systematic .(industrialisation during the british rule in india
18578,it was required to fulfill the emerging needs of industrial inputs in the wake of industrial revolution in britain
18579,to exploit india as a potential market for the industrial products of britain
18580,"foreign trade india had occupied a place of eminence in the area of foreign trade, since ancient times"
18581,drain of india’s wealth huge administrative expenses were incurred by the british government to manage their colonial i ale in india
18582,also huge expenses were incurred by the british government to fight wars in pursuit of their policy of imperialism
18583,demographic condition demographic conditions during the british rule exhibited all features of a stagnant and backward economy
18584,both birth rate and death rate were very high nearly 48 and 40 per thousand respectively
18585,occupational structure greater dependence on agriculture as suggested by occupational structure on the eve of independence implied lesser availability of land per head for the farming population
18586,accordingly agriculture was taken largely as a means of subsistence and less as an occupation for profit
18587,infrastructure infrastructure refer to the elements of economic change as well as elements of social change which serve as a foundation for growth and development of a country
18588,development of infrastructure is a precondition to the economic and social development of a country
18589,"economy of a country includes all production, distribution or economic activities that relates with people an determines the standard of living"
18590,on the eve of independence indian economy was in a very bad shape due to the presence of british colonial rule
18591,the only purpose of britishers was to unjustly enrich themselves at the cost of india’s economic development
18592,"thus, in 1947, when british transferred power back to india, we inherited a crippled economy"
18593,india’s national and per capital income under colonial rule there were no efforts from the part of the colonial government to measure the national and per capital income of india
18594,some individual attempts were made to measure such incomes but produced conflicting and inconsistent results
18595,the contribution of vkrv rao and dadabhai naoroji are considered very significant in this context
18596,low economic growth under colonial rule india had an independent economy before the arrival of british rule
18597,"but the britishers, dominated it for over a period of 200 years"
18598,britishers framed policies that protected and promoted the economic interests of their own country
18599,they transformed india into supplier of raw materials and consumer of finished goods from the factories of britain
18600,"in this context, we will discuss the conditions of certain sectors that were badly affected by the presence of colonial rule, i.e"
18601,"state of agriculture sector agriculture was the main source of livelihood for most of the people of india, and about 85% of the country’s population lived mostly in villages and derived livelihood directly or indirectly from agriculture"
18602,"inspite of such a large segment of the population being dependent of agriculture, either directly or indirectly, this sector was facing stagnation and constant deterioration, as is brought forward through the following points"
18603,"this led to a low level of output, inspite of a large area under cultivation"
18604,high degree of vulnerability agriculture was vulnerable to climatic factors and mostly affected by erratic rainfall
18605,poor rainfall generally led to a low level of output and also to crop failures
18606,no effort was made by british government to provide permanent source of irrigation facilities for the farmers
18607,the reasons for stagnation of agricultural sector were (i) land revenue system the britishers introduced the zamindari system
18608,zamindars were to pay a fixed sum to the government as land revenue and they were absolutely free to extract as much from the tillers of the soil as they could
18609,their main interest was in rent collection regardless of the economic conditions of cultivators and this caused misery and social tension among the latter
18610,"apart from this there are two more systems namely, the ryotwari and the mahalwari were prevalent"
18611,"(ii) lacking of resources because the tillers had to pay huge amount of rent, referred to as ‘lagaan’, they were not left with any surplus to be able to provide for resources needed in agriculture in the form of fertilisers or providing for irrigation facilities"
18612,(iii) commercialisation of agriculture commercialisation of agriculture refers to shift from cultivation for self-consumption to cultivation for sale in the market
18613,"it also refers to cultivation of cash-crops like cotton, indigo, etc"
18614,"due to commercialisation of agriculture, there was some evidences of a relatively higher yield of cash crops in certain areas of the country"
18615,but this could not help in improving the conditions of indian farmers
18616,"instead of producing food crops, farmers were producing cash crops, which were ultimately to be used by british industries"
18617,"state of industrial sector in the pre-british period, india was particularly well-known for its handicraft industries, in the fields of cotton and silk textiles, metal and precious stone works, etc"
18618,these products enjoyed a worldwide market based on the reputation of the fine quality of material used and the high standards of craftsmanship
18619,but the britishers followed a policy of systematic de-industrialisation by creating circumstances conducive to the decay of handicraft industry and not taking any steps to promote modern industry and reduced india to a mere exporter of raw material and importer of finished goods
18620,the following points bring farword the state of the industrial sector at the eve of independence 1
18621,"decay of handicraft industry the traditional handicraft industry in india enjoyed worldwide reputation, but the british misrule in india led to the decline of indian handicraft industry"
18622,the britishers adopted the following policies to systematically destroy the handicraft industry
18623,"discriminatory tariff policy of the state the britishers followed a discriminatory tariff policy by allowing tariff free exports of raw material from india (to provide for the requirements of their industries in britain) and tariff free import of british industrial products (to promote british goods in india), but placed a heavy duty on the export of handicraft products"
18624,"so, indian handicraft products started loosing their domestic as well as foreign markets"
18625,competition from machine-made products machine-made products from britain were cheap and better in quality than the handicraft products
18626,this competition forced many a handicrafts to shut down their business
18627,"introduction of railways in india the britishers introduced railways in india, to expand the market of its low priced industrial products"
18628,"consequently, the demand of high-priced handicraft products started to fall, thus leading to the downfall of handicraft industry"
18629,this development was confined to the setting up of cotton and jute textile mills
18630,"subsequently, the iron and steel industries began coming up in the beginning of the 20th century"
18631,"in this context, the tata iron and steel company (tisco) was incorporated in august, 1907 in india"
18632,"it established its first plant in jamshedpur [bihar, at present jharkhand]"
18633,"lopsided industrial structure the industrial growth was lopsided, in the sense that consumer goods industry was not adequately supported by the capital goods industry"
18634,lack of basic and heavy industries no priority was given for the development of basic and heavy industries
18635,tata iron and steel mills was the only basic industry in india
18636,"textile industry in bengal muslin is a type of cotton textile which had its origin in bengal,particularly, places in and around dhaka (now the capital city of bangladesh)"
18637,daccai muslin had gained worldwide fame as an exquisite type of cotton textile
18638,"foreign travellers also used to refer to it as malmal shahi or malmal khas meaning that it was worn by or fit for, the royalty"
18639,state of foreign trade india has been an important trading nation since ancient times
18640,"but when the restrictive policies of commodity production, trade and tariff were imposed by the colonial government, it adversely affected the structure, composition and volume of india’s foreign trade"
18641,following were the reasons behind the poor growth of foreign trade 1
18642,"exporter of primary products and importer of finished goods under the colonial rule, india became an exporter of primary products such as raw silk, cotton, wool, sugar, indigo, jute, etc and an importer of finished consumer goods like cotton, silk and woollen clothes and capital goods like light machinery produced in the factories of britain"
18643,britain’s monopoly control britain maintained a monopoly control over india’s exports and imports
18644,"due to this, more than half of india’s foreign trade was restricted to britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like; china, ceylon (sri lanka) and persia (iran)"
18645,the opening of suez canal in 1869 further intensified british control over india’s foreign trade
18646,drain of india’s wealth an important characteristic of foreign trade throughout the colonial period was the generation of a large export surplus
18647,"but this surplus came at a huge cost to the country’s econo several essential commodities like food grains, kerosene, were scarcely available in the domestic market"
18648,"also, this surplus was not used in any developmental activity of india"
18649,"rather, it was used to maintain the administrative set-up of the britishers or bear the expenses of war taught by britain"
18650,"state of occupational structure during the colonial period, the occupational structure of india exhibited its backwardness"
18651,the agricultural sector accounted for the largest share of the work force which remained at a high of 70-75% of the work force and the manufacturing and services sectors accounted for only 10 and 15-20% respectively
18652,"there existed a growing regional disparity with few states such as orissa, rajasthan and punjab witnessing an increase in agricultural workforce while the states which were the parts of madras presidency"
18653,bombay and bengal witnessed a decline in the percentage of work force dependent on agriculture
18654,state of infrastructure infrastructure comprises of such industries which help in the growth of other industries
18655,"under the colonial period, basic infrastructure such as railways, port per transport, posts and telegraphs developed"
18656,"however, the real motive behind this development was not to provide basic amenities to the people but to sub serve various colonial interests"
18657,the state of infrastructure under the colonial rule can be understood with the help of following points 1
18658,roads roads constructed before independence were not fit for modern transport
18659,it was very difficult to reach rural areas during rainy season
18660,the roads were built only to serve the purpose of mobilising the army within india and transporting raw materials from the countryside to the nearest railway station or the port for exporting it
18661,railways british rulers introduced railways in india in 1850 and it began its operation in 1853
18662,it is considered as one of the important contribution of britishers
18663,the railways affected the structure of the indian economy in the following two ways it enabled people to undertake long distance travel and thereby break geographical and cultural barriers
18664,it fostered commercialisation of indian agriculture which adversely affected the self-sufficiency of the village economies in india
18665,"so, the social .benefits provided by the railways was outweighed by the country’s huge economic loss"
18666,water and air transport the colonial rulers took measures for the development of water transport
18667,"the inland waterways, at times, also proved uneconomical as in the case of the coast canal on the orissa coast"
18668,the main purpose behind their development was to serve britain’s colonial interest
18669,the colonial government also showed way to the air transport in 1932 by establishing tata airlines
18670,"thus, in this way it inaugurated the aviation sector in india"
18671,the introduction of the expensive system of electric telegraph in india served the purpose of maintaining law and order
18672,demographic condition various details about the population of british india were first collected through a census in 1881
18673,"before 1921, india was in the first stage of demographic transition"
18674,however neither the total population of india nor the rate of population growth at this stage was very high
18675,"though suffering from certain limitations, it revealed the unevenness in india’s population growth"
18676,the population grew at a rate of 1.2% up to the year 1951
18677,on the eve of independence the demographic condition was as follows the overall literacy level was less than 16%
18678,the female literacy level was at a negligible low rate of about 7%
18679,"public health facilities were either unavailable to large chunks of population or when available, were highly inadequate"
18680,infant mortality rate was 218 per thousand in contrast to present infant mortality rate of 63 per thousand
18681,life expectancy was very low 44 years in contrast to the present 66 years
18682,both birth rate and death rate were very high at 48 and 40 per thousand of persons respectively
18683,human capital it refers to the stock of ‘skill and expertise’ of a nation at a point of time
18684,human capital formation it is the process of adding to the stock of human capital over time
18685,physical capital it refers to the stock of produced means of production
18686,financial capital it refers to the stocks/shares of the companies or these are simple financial claims against assets of the companies
18687,sources of human capital formation expenditure on education expenditure on health on-the-job training study programmes for adults migration expenditure on information human capital formation and economic growth higher productivity of physical capital human capital formation increases productivity of physical capital specialised engineers and skilled workers can certainly handle machines better than the other
18688,innovative skills it facilitates the use and growth of innovative skills
18689,"higher rate of participation and equality by enhancing productive capacities of the labour force, human capital formation induces greater employment"
18690,"thus, there is a cause and effect relationship between human capital formation and economic growth"
18691,"problems facing by human capital formation in india rising population brain drain desicient man power planning law academic standards human capital and human development human capital and human development are related concepts, but certainly not identical"
18692,"education as an essential element of human resource development it implies the process of teaching training and learning especially in schools or colleges, to improve knowledge and develop skills"
18693,"growth of education sector in india following observations highlight the growth of education sector in india expansion of general education primary education secondary education higher education vocationalisation of secondary education technical, medical and agricultural education rural education adult and female education total literacy campaign education still a challenging proposition education system of the country which along with the following facts makes education still challenging proposition in india"
18694,"large number of illiterates inadequate vocationalisation gender bias low rural access level privatisation low government expenditure on education right to education (rte) in the year 2012, the government of india has brought about an act, called rte"
18695,it makes education a matter of right to all children in the age group of 6-14 years
18696,"the concept of human capital formation, source of human capital and its growth is revealed in the chapter"
18697,"it also deals with the relationship among human capital, economic growth and human development"
18698,"concepts and sources of human capital formation just as a country can turn physical resources like land into physical capital like factories, similarly it can also turn human resources like students into engineers and doctors"
18699,"so, human capital formation aims at converting human resources into human assets"
18700,"human capital and physical capital human capital it refers to the stock of skill, ability, expertise, education and knowledge in a nation at a point of time"
18701,"physical capital all inputs which are required for further production such as machine, tools and implements, factory buildings, etc are called physical capital"
18702,"human capital formation it is the process of acquiring and increasing the number of people who* have the skills, education and experience which are critical for the economic and political development of a country"
18703,"in other words, human capital formation is the process of adding to the stock of human capital over time"
18704,"meier defines human capital formation as, “human capital formation is the process of acquiring and increasing the number of persons who have the skiff education and experience which are essential for the economic and political development of a country”"
18705,sources of human capital formation investment in education is considered as one of the most important sources of human capital formation
18706,"investment in health, on-the-job training, migration and information are the other sources of human capital formation"
18707,expenditure on education the education expenditure is an important source of human capital formation as it is the most effective way on enhancing and enlarging a productive workforce in the country
18708,nations and individuals invest in education with the objective increasing their future income
18709,"generating technical skills and creating manpower, well suited for improving labour productivity and thus, sustaining rapid economic development"
18710,"tending to bring down birth rate which in turn, brings decline in population growth rate"
18711,"education also results in social benefits since, it also spreads to others"
18712,expenditure on health health is another important source of human capital formation
18713,a sick labourer without access to medical facilities is compelled to abstain from work and there in a loss of productivity
18714,"the various forms of health expenditure are preventive medicine, curative medicine, social medicine, provision of clean drinking water, etc"
18715,on-the-job training expenditure regarding on-the-job training is a source of human capital formation as the return of such expenditure in the form of enhanced labour productivity is more than the cost of it
18716,firms spend huge amounts on giving on-the-job training to their workers
18717,it may be in different forms like a worker may be trained in the firm itself or under the supervision of a skilled worker or can be sent for off campus training
18718,the firms then insist that workers should work for atleast some time in die company so that they can recover the benefits of the enhanced productivity owing to the training
18719,migration people sometimes migrate from one place to the other in search of better jobs that fetch them higher salaries than what they may get in their native places
18720,it includes migration of people from rural areas to urban areas in india
18721,unemployment is the reason for the rural urban migration in india and technically qualified people migrate from one country to another in order to get high salaries
18722,"expenditure on information people spent to acquire information relating to the labour market and other markets like education, health, etc"
18723,"for example, people seek information regarding salaries and other facilities available in different labour markets, so that they can choose the right job"
18724,expenditure incurred for acquiring information regarding labour markets and other markets like education and health have also becomes an important source of human capital formation
18725,formation in intiter human capital and economic growth india recognised the importance of human capital in economic growth long ago
18726,"the seventh five year plan says, ‘human resources development has necessarily to be assigned a key role in any development strategy, particularly in a country with a large population’"
18727,the following points show clearly the interdependence among the two higher productivity of physical capital human capital increases productivity of physical capital as specialised and skilled workers can handle machines or techniques better than the unskilled works
18728,this increased productivity and hence production in leads to economic growth
18729,innovative skills human capital facilitates innovation of new methods of production and this increase the rate of economic growth in the form of increase in gdp
18730,higher rate of participation and equality human capital formation leads to a higher employment rate
18731,"also, increase in employment opportunities also increases the level of income and this helps in reducing inequalities of wealth"
18732,"both, increase in employment rate and decrease in income inequalities are pointers of economic development"
18733,"brings positive outlook the process of human capital formation bring in a positive outlook to the society which is different from orthodox and traditional ways of thinking, and hence increases the rate of participation in the workforce causes increase in level of production"
18734,india as a knowledge economy the indian software industry has been showing an impressive record over the past decade
18735,"entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and politicians are now advancing views about how india can transform itself into a knowledge-based economy by using information technology (it)"
18736,there have been some instances of villagers using e-mail which are cited as examples of such transformation
18737,"likewise, e-governance is being projected as the way of the future"
18738,the value of it depends greatly on the existing level of economic development
18739,human capital and human development human development is the broader term than human capital
18740,human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity
18741,"human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because when people have the ability to read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, they will be able to make other choices they value"
18742,"in human capital view, any investment in education and health is unproductive, if it-does not enhance output of goods and services"
18743,"in the human development perspective, human beings are ends in themselves"
18744,"therefore, basic education and basic health are important in themselves, irrespective of their contribution to labour productivity"
18745,according to two independent reports one from deutsche and other from world bank have identified that india would grow faster due to its strength in human capital formation
18746,"according to deutsche bank (a german bank)’s report on global growth centres, it has been identified tha india will emerge as one among four major growth centres in the world by 2020"
18747,"this report also says that between 2005 to 2020, we expect a 40% rise in the average years of education in india, to just above 7 years"
18748,"world’s bank report india and the knowledge economy-leveraging strengths and opportunities states that india should make a transition to the knowledge economy and if it uses its knowledge as much as ireland does, then the per capita income of india will increase from a little over us $1000 in 2002 to us $3000 in 2020"
18749,"it further states that the indian economy has all the key ingredients for making this transition such as a critical mass of skilled workers, a well functioning democracy and a diversified science and technology infrastructure"
18750,thus two reports point out the fact that further human capital formation in india will move its economy to a higher growth
18751,problems of human capital formation in india the main problems of human capital formation in india are rising population rapidly rising population adversely affects the quality of human capital in under developed and developing countries like india
18752,"it reduces per head availability of existing facilities like sanitation, employment, drainage, water system, housing, hospitals, education, food supply, nutrition, roads, electricity, etc"
18753,brain drain migration of highly skilled labour termed as ‘brain drain
18754,this slow down the process of human capital formation in the domestic economy
18755,inefficient of manpower planning there is inefficient manpower planning in less developed countries where no efforts have been made either to raise the standard of education at different stages pr to maintain the demand and supply of technical labour force
18756,it is a sad reflection on the wastage of human power and human skill
18757,long-term process the process of human development is a long-term policy because skill formation takes time
18758,this also lowers our competitiveness in the international market of human capital
18759,high poverty levels a large proportion of the population lives below poverty line and do not have access to basic health and educational facilities
18760,a large section of society cannot afford to get higher education or expensive medical treatment for major disease
18761,"human developent index the human developent index (hdi) is a composite statistic of life expectance education, and income indices rank countries into four tiers of human development"
18762,"it was created by economist mahbub ul haq, followed by economist amartya sen in 1990, and published by the united nations development programme"
18763,"education sector in india education implies the process of teaching, training and learning especially in schools or colleges, to improve knowledge and develop skills"
18764,following points explain the important or objective of education it produces good citizens
18765,it facilities use of natural and human resources of all regions of the country
18766,growth in government expenditure on education government expenditure on education can be expressed in two ways as a percentage of‘total government expenditure
18767,the percentage of ‘education expenditure of total government expenditure’ indicates the importance of education in the scheme of expenses before the government
18768,expenditure on education out of our gdp shows how much we are committed towards the development of education in our country
18769,"during 1952-2010, education expenditure as percentage of total government expenditure increased from"
18770,7.92% to 11.1% and as percentage of gdp increased from 0.64% to 3.25%
18771,expenditure on elementary education in india elementary education takes a major share of total education expenditure and the share of the higher/tertiary education is the least
18772,but expenditure per student on tertiary education is higher than that of elementary
18773,"as we expand school education, we need more teachers who are trained in the higher educational institutions, therefore, expenditure on all levels of education should be increased"
18774,free and compulsory education the education commission (1964-66) had recommended that atleast 6% of gdp to be spent on education so as to make a noticeable rate of growth in education
18775,"in december 2002, the government of india, through the 86th amendment of the constitution of india, made free and compulsory education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years"
18776,"the tapas majumdar committee, which estimated an expenditure of around 1.37 lakh crore over 10 years (1998-99 to 2006-07) to bring all indian children in the age group of 6-14 years, under the purview of school education"
18777,desired level of expenditure an education is 6% of gdp but the current level is little over 4% which is not inadequate
18778,it is necessary to reach the level of 6% which is considered as must for coming years
18779,"recently, government of india has started levying a 2% ‘education cess’ on all union taxes"
18780,the revenues from education cess has been earmarked for spending on elementary education
18781,"thus, it has set some future prospects for framing its policies"
18782,these prospects are discussed below education for all : still a distant dream although the education level in india has risen for both adults as well as for youth
18783,still the number of illiterates in india are as much as the population was at the time of independence
18784,"in 1950, when the constitution of india was passed by the constituent assembly, it was noted in the directive principles of the constitution that the government should provide free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 years within 10 years from the commencement of the constitution"
18785,"the following factors makes education still a distant dream large number of illiterates inadequate vocationalisation gender bias low rural access level privatisation low government expenditure on education gender equity : better than before the differences in literacy rates between males and females are narrowing, signifying a positive development in gender equity; still the need to promote education for women in india is imminent for various reasons, such as improving economic independence"
18786,"therefore, we cannot show the satisfaction about the upward movement in literacy rates as we have miles to go in achieving cent percent adult literacy"
18787,"in india, mizoram, kerala, goa and delhi are the states having high literacy rate, while bihar, uttar pradesh, rajasthan and arunachal pradesh are the educationally backward states"
18788,the educational backwardness is due to social and economic poverty of the people
18789,"higher education : a few takers the indian education pyramid is steep, indicating lesser and lesser number of people reaching the higher education level"
18790,"as per nssg (national sample survey organisation) data, in the year 2007-08, the rate of unemployment for youth with education up to secondary level and above was 18.1% whereas, the rate of unemployment for youth with education up to primary level was only 11.6%"
18791,"therefore, the government should increase allocation for higher education and also improve the standard of higher education institutes, so that students are imparted employable skills in such institutions indian economic development class 11 notes class 11 economics notes"

18809,"it also addresses the growth rate of indian economy and various employment generation, schemes"
18810,it also specifies the need of transformation of workers from in formal sector to formal sector
18811,employment and informalisation of indian workforce work plays an important role in our lives as an individual or a group of members can earn their living after doing work
18812,being employed gives us a sense of self-worth and enables us to relate ourselves meaningfully with others
18813,"in this way, every working person can actively contribute towards national income"
18814,"thus, there is need to know who is a worker and what is an employment"
18815,a person is classed as a worker if he has contract or agreement to do work
18816,"so, it can be concluded that all those who are engaged in production activities, in whatever capacity high or low, are workers.” types of workers broadly, workers can be categorised into self-employed and hired workers"

18825,according to gender 50% of male workers are self-employed and 50% of male workers are hired
18826,53% of female workers are self-employed and 47% of female workers are hired
18827,distribution of employment by gender the above chart shows that self-employment and hired employment are equally important for male workers
18828,but female workers give preference to self-employment than to hired employment
18829,"it is because women, both in rural and urban areas are less mobile and thus, prefer to engage themselves in self employment"
18830,"so, it can be concluded that self-employment is a very important source of livelihood for people in india"
18831,"the data on the size of workforce in india are as follows about 70% of the workforce comprises of male workers, only 30% are female workers, nearly, 70% of workforce is found in rural areas i and only 30% is in urban areas"

18903,the number of unemployed has actually increased instead of decreasing during the plan period
18904,faulty employment planning the five year plans in india have not been designed for employment generation
18905,a frontal attack to solve the problem of unemployment is missing

18914,"since independence, the union and state government have played an important role in generating employment or creating opportunities for employment generation"
18915,"their efforts can be broadly categorised into two i.e., direct and indirect"
18916,"direct employment, in this government employs people in various departments for administrative purposes"
18917,"it also runs industries, hotels and transport companies and hence provides employment directly to workers"
18918,"indirect employment it can be understood as when output of goods and services from government enterprises increases, then private enterprises which receive now materials from government enterprises will also raise their output and hence increase the number of employment opportunities in the economy"
18919,this is the indirect generation of employment opportunities by the government initiatives in the economy
18920,employment generation programmes many programmes that governments implement with the aim of alleviating poverty through employment generation are called employment generation programmes

18929,features of sustainable development sustained rise in real per capita income and economic welfare rational use of natural resources no reduction in the ability of future generations to meet their own needs no increase in pollution strategies for sustainable development input-efficient technology
18930,factors contributing to deforestation growing industrial demand for wood and other forest products
18931,the economic development we have achieved so far is on the cost of environmental degradation
18932,"the era of globlisation promises higher economic growth, but on the same side it had adverse consequences that had impacted environment"
18933,"in order to understand the sustainable path of development, the significance and contribution of environment to economic development should be understood"

18939,"resources which can be used without any fear of getting depleted are renewable sources of energy, e.g"
18940,it is generally in form of garbage which is absorbed by the environment
18941,"sustains life sun, soil, air, water are the essential ingredients of environment for the human life"
18942,absence of these will lead to an end of life on the earth
18943,"aesthetic services environment provides aesthetic services like scenery, which includes rivers, ocean, mountains and deserts"
18944,environmental crisis the environment is performing its functions without any interruption as long as the demand of these functions is within its carrying capacity
18945,"this means that if the rate of extraction of resources will be above the rate of their regeneration, the environment will fail to perform its functions"
18946,resources are becoming extinct and wastes are generated beyond the absorptive capacity of the environment
18947,"all this has lead to the environmental crisis, it refers to ecological crisis that occurs when the environment of a species or a population changes and destabalises its survival"
18948,"consequence of environmental crisis the points given below describe the consequences of environmental crisis development has polluted and dried up rivers and other aquifers, which was deteriorated the quality of water"
18949,"intensive and extensive excavation of both renewable and non-renewable resources has exhausted some of the vital resources, compelling to spend a huge amount of money on technology and research to explore new resources"
18950,"decline in air and water quality have resulted in increased number of respiratory and water borne diseases i.e., expenditure of health care is also rising according to a data 70% of water of"
18951,global environmental issues the environmental issues which affect the whole world are called global environmental issues such as global warming and ozone depletion
18952,these issues also contribute to increased financial commitments for the government
18953,global warming the gradual increase in the average temperature of earth’s lower atmosphere is called global warming
18954,"causes/effects it occurs due to greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and other gases which have the capacity to absorb heat) through burning of fossil fuels (coal and petroleum) and deforestation (increases the carbon dioxide level in atmosphere)"
18955,much of the recent observed and projected global warming is human induced
18956,the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane have increased by 31% and 149% respectively above pre-industrial level since 1750
18957,"different effects of global warming are described below during the past century, the atmospheric temperature has risen by 1.10° f (0.60° c)"
18958,"melting of polar ice resulting in increase in sea level (during the past century, sea level has risen by several inches) and the risk of coastal flooding has increased"
18959,"action taken a united nations conference on climate change, held in tokyo, japan, in 1997, resulted in an international agreement to fight global warming which called for reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised nations"
18960,ozone depletion it refers to the phenomenon of reductions in the amount of ozone layer in the stratosphere
18961,causes/effects it is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere
18962,"origin of these compounds are chloro flurocarbons (cfcs), used as cooling substances in air conditioners and refrigerators or as aerosol propellants and bromofluro-carbons.(halons) used in fire extinguishers"
18963,"different effects of ozone depletion are described below more ultraviolet radiation comes to earth causing damage to living organisms, skin cancer in humans, low production of phytopjankton affecting acquatic organisms"
18964,"action taken between 1979 to 1990, a reduction of 5% in ozone layer was detected"
18965,"since ozone layer prevents most harmful ultraviolet radiation from passing through the earth’s atmosphere, so reduction in ozone layer generated worldwide concern, leading to adoption of the montreal protocol banning the use of chloroflurocarbon jcfc) compounds as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, tricholoroethane (also known as methyl chloroform) and bromine compounds known as halons"
18966,state of india’s environment india has rich quality of natural resources in plenty of amount
18967,"it is clear from the following points india has rich quality of soil, hundreds of rivers and tributaries, lush green forests, plenty of mineral deposits beneath the land surface, vast stretch of the indian ocean, ranges of mountains, etc"
18968,the black soil of the deccan plateau is particularly suitable for cultivation of cotton
18969,it has lead to concentration of textile industries in this region
18970,"the indo gangetic plains spread from arabian sea to the bay of bengal are one of the most-fertile, intensively cultivated and densely populated regions in the world"
18971,"india’s forests though unevenly distributed, provide green cover for majority of its population and natural cover for its wildlife"
18972,"large deposits of iron-ore, coal and natural gas are found in the country"
18973,india alone accounts for nearly 20% of the world’s total iron-ore reserves
18974,"bauxite, copper, chromate, diamonds, gold, lead, lignite, manganese, zinc, uranium, etc are also available in different parts of the country"
18975,"threat to india’s environment threat to india’s environment is poverty, pollution, rapidly growing industrial sector"
18976,"air pollution, water contamination, soil erosion, deforestation and wildlife extinction are some of the most pressing environmental concerns of india"
18977,"the developmental activities in india have resulted in pressure on its finite natural resources, besides creating impacts on human health and well-being"
18978,out of them the priority issues are land degradation and solid waste management biodiversity loss air pollution with special reference to vehicular pollution in urban cities management of fresh water some of these issues are discussed below land degradation in india land in india suffers from varying degrees and types of degradation stemming mainly from unstable use and inappropriate management practices
18979,the factors responsible for land degradation in india are loss of vegetation occuring due to deforestation
18980,biodiversity loss india is the owner of 2.5% of world’s geographical area
18981,india holds 17% of human and 20% of livestock population on its land
18982,"in order to hold livestock and human in country, country needs 0.47 hectare of land to meet the basic needs but it has only 0.08 hectare of land which causes felling of forests and soil erosion"
18983,as a result quantity of nutrients lost due to erosion each year ranges from 5.8 to 8.4 million tonnes
18984,"in karnataka, a similar movement took a different name, ‘chpiko’, which means to hug"
18985,"on 8th september 1983, when the felling of trees was.started in salkani forest in sirsi district, 160 men, women and children hug|ed the trees and forced the woodcutters to leave"
18986,they kept vigil in the forest over the next six weeks
18987,"only after the forest officials assured the volunteers of the trees will be cut scientifically and in accordance with the working plan of the district, did they leave the trees, when commercial felling by contractors damaged a large number of natural forests, the idea of hugging the trees gave the people hope and confidence that they can protect the forests"
18988,"on that particular incident, with the felling discontinued, the people saved 12000 trees"
18989,"air pollution in india, air pollution is widespread in urban areas where vehicles are the major contributors and in a few other areas which have a high concentration of industries and thermal power plants"
18990,pollution from vehicles and industries are the major sources of air pollution
18991,"vehicle pollution vehicle emissions are of particular concern since these are ground level sources and thus, have the maximum impact on the general pollution"
18992,the number of vehicles has increased from 3 lakh in 1957 to 67 crores in 2003
18993,"in 2003, personal transport vehicles (two wheeled and cars only) contributed about 80% of the total number of registered vehicles thus, contributing significantly to air pollution load"
18994,industrial pollution india is one of the ten most industrialised nations of the world
18995,"this status has brought with it unwanted and unanticipated consequences like unplanned urbanisation, pollution and the risk of accidents"
18996,the cpcb (central pollution control board) has identified seventeen categories of industries (large and medium scale) as significantly polluting
18997,management of fresh water water is an equally important element of life and its pollution is equally serious
18998,water becomes polluted when chemicals and other waste materials are dumped into it
18999,polluted water is the principal cause of diseases like diarrhoea and hepatitis
19000,"thus, the management of fresh water is essential to sustain life"
19001,"pollution control boards to address two major environmental concerns in india; water, air and land pollution, the government set up the central pollution control board (cpcb) in 1974"
19002,this was followed by states establishing their own state level boards to address all the environmental concerns
19003,"different functions of pollution control boards are to investigate, collect and disseminate information relating to water, air and land pollution"
19004,"to provide technical assistance to governments in promoting cleanliness of streams and wells by prevention, control and abatement of water pollution"
19005,"to improve the quality of air and to prevent, control or abate air pollution in the country"
19006,"to carryout and sponsor investigation and research relating to problems of water and air pollution and for their prevention, control and abatement"
19007,"to prepare manual, codes and guidelines relating to treatment and disposal of sewage and trade effluents"
19008,"state boards through their district officials, periodically inspect every industry under their jurisdiction to assess the adequacy of treatment measures provided to treat the effluent and gaseous emissions"
19009,state pollution boards also provide background air quality data needed for industrial siting and town planning
19010,"in nutshell, it can be said that pollution control boards collect, collate and disseminate technical and statistical data relating to water pollution"
19011,"they monitor the quality of water in 125 rivers (including the tribunaries), wells, lakes, ponds, tanks, drains and canals"
19012,"the various measures adopted by ministry of environment and the central and state pollution control boards may not yield reward unless, we make ourself concious"
19013,following are required measures which should be taken to save the environment social awareness there should be awareness among the people regarding the threats of the increasing pollution and how can each of us contribute to the check this menace
19014,population control biggest issue which should be controlled is increasing population to protect the environment
19015,enforcement of environment conservation act the environment act was passed in year 1986
19016,it was passed to check the detoriated quality of the environment
19017,afforestation campaign extensive afforestation campaign should be launched to protect environment
19018,"water management there should be means which can harvest the rain water in order to use it in the areas where there is scarcity of water, so that clean drinking water can be provided to the rural people"
19019,management of solid waste management of solid waste is very essential
19020,"meaning, features, needs and strategies for sustainable development according to the united nations conference on environment and development (unced), sustainable development can be defined as “development strategy that meets the need of present generation without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs.” edward barbier, a renowned personality had also given the definition of sustainable development sustainable development is one which is directly concerned with increasing the material standards of living of the poor at grass root level"
19021,"in specific term, sustainable development aims at decreasing the absolute poverty of the poor by providing lasting and securing livelihoods that minimise resource depletion, environmental degradation, cultural disruption and social instability"
19022,"a moral obligation to hand over the planet earth in good order to the future generation, i"
19023,"e., the present generation should bequeath a better environment to the future generation"
19024,"the present generation can promote development that enhances the natural and built environment in the way, that are compatible with conservation of natural as us"
19025,preservation of the regenerative capacity of the worlds natural ecological system
19026,avoiding the imposition of added costs or risks on future generation
19027,features of sustainable development sustained rise in real per capital income and economic welfare
19028,no reduction in the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
19029,"a way to sustainable development according to herman dalay, a leading environmental economist, the main needs of sustainable development are limiting the human population to a level within the carrying capacity of the environment"
19030,"renewable resources should be extracted on a sustainable basis, i.e., rate of extraction should not exceed rate of regeneration"
19031,"for non-renewable resources, rate of depletion should not exceed the rate of creation of renewable substitutes"
19032,use of non-conventional sources of energy india heavily depends on thermal and hydro power plants to meet its power needs
19033,"thermal power plants emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas"
19034,"if it is not used properly, it may cause land and water pollution"
19035,"lpg, gobar gas in rural areas rural households in india generally use wood, dungcake (upla) or other biomass as fuel"
19036,"this practice has several adverse implications like deforestation, reduction in green cover and air pollution"
19037,"besides it, gobar gas plants are being encouraged through easy loans and subsidy"
19038,it does not create any household pollution and also wastage is minimised
19039,"for gobar gas plants, cattle dung is fed in the plant to function which produces gas and slurry is used as organic soil fertiliser"
19040,"cng in urban areas in delhi, the use of compressed natural gas (cng) as fuel in public transport system has significantly lowered air pollution and the air has become cleaner in the last few years"
19041,"wind power in areas, where speed of wind is usually high, wind mills can provide electricity without any adverse impact on the environment"
19042,its initial cost’ remain high but it can be recovered easily
19043,"solar power through photovoltaic cells in india, solar energy is used in different forms for agriculture products, daily use products and even to warm ourselves in winters"
19044,this technology is extremely useful for remote areas and for places where supply of power lines is either not possible or proves very costly
19045,"bio composting in order to increase production, we have started using chemical fertilisers which are adversely affecting the waterbodies, ground water system, etc"
19046,but again farmers in large numbers have started using organic fertilisers for production
19047,"in some parts, cattles are maintained only because their waste prouction is very useful in form of fertiliser"
19048,earthworm can convert organic matter into compost faster than the normal composting process
19049,mini-hydel plants use the energy of such streams to move small turbines which generate electricity
19050,"traditional knowledge and practices traditionally, indian people have been close to their environment"
19051,"if we look back at our agriculture system, healthcare system, housing, transport, etc we find that all practices have been environment friendly"
19052,"but in recent years, we have been moving away from these practices"
19053,"during older times, we used ayurveda, unani, tibetan and folk systems for the treatments but now we are ignoring the traditional system and we are moving towards the western system"
19054,not only these products were environment friendly but they are free from side effects too
19055,"biopest control with the advent of green revolution, the country entered into the use of chemical pesticides to produce more which laid the adverse impacts on soil, water bodies, milk, meat and fishes"
19056,"to meet this challenge, better methods of pest control should be brought"
19057,"even many animals also help in controlling pests like snakes, peacocks, etc"
19058,development of infrastructure human capital formation development of productive resources poverty alleviation land reforms rural credit rural credit means credit for the farming families
19059,credit is the life line of farming activity credit needs of the typical indian farmer may broadly be classified as under short term credit it needs relates basically to the purchase of inputs like seeds fertilisers etc short term borrowings generally stretches over a period of 6 to 12 months

19065,diversification of crop production it implies production of diverse variety of crops rather than one specialised crop
19066,diversification of production activity/employment it implies a shift from crop farming to other areas of production activity employment
19067,non-farm areas of production activity/employment for the rural population animal husbandry it is the most important area of employment in india different from crop farming
19068,fisheries the fishing community in india depends almost equally on inland sources and marine sources of fishing
19069,"horticulture horticultural crops include fruits, vegetables and flowers besides several other"
19070,"over time, there has been a substantial increase in area under horticulture"

19072,organic farming and substainable development organic farming is a system of farming that relies upon the use of organic inputs for cultivation
19073,"benefits of organic farming are as follows discards the use of non-renewable resources environment friendly sustains soil fertility healthier and tastier food in expensive technology for the small and marginal farmers golden revolution the rapid growth in the production of diverse horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, tuper crops and plantation crops is known as golden revolution"
19074,agriculture is the major source of livelihood in the rural sector
19075,mahatma gandhi once said that “real progress of india did not mean only the industrial growth but also the development of villages because two-third of india’s population depends on agriculture”
19076,"this is the reason, why there is need to develop rural india"
19077,rural development and rural credit rural development is a comprehensive term which essentially focuses on action for the development of areas that are lagging behind in the overall development of the village economy
19078,"it is a process whereby the standard of living of rural people, especially poor people, rises continuously"

19080,"generating alternative means of livelihood in the rural areas, so that dependency on agriculture sector is reduced"
19081,"promoting education and health facilities in the rural areas, so that human development is also achieved"

19083,development of human resources including literacy (more specifically female literacy) education and skill development
19084,"development of human resources like health, addressing both sanitation and public health"
19085,"infrastructure development like electricity, irrigation, credit, marketing, transport facilities including construction of village roads and feeder roads to nearby highways, facilities for agriculture research and extension and information dissemination"
19086,special measures for alleviation of poverty and bringing about significant improvement in the living conditions of the weaker sections of the populations emphasising access to productive employment opportunities
19087,"the share of agriculture sector’s contribution to gdp was on a decline, the population dependent on this sector did not show any significant change"
19088,"further, after the initiation of reforms, the growth rate of agriculture sector decelerated to 2.3% per annum during the 1990s, which was lower than the earlier years"
19089,rural credit credit is the life line of the farming activity
19090,farmers need credit because most formers in india are small and marginal land holders who practice subsistence farming
19091,"so, farmers have to borrow to fulfill their various needs during this period"
19092,"borrowings of afarmer can befor thefollowingpurpose productive borrowings these borrowings include loans to buy seeds, fertilisers and agricultural equipments and imptements"
19093,un-productive borrowings these borrowings include loans for social purposes such as marriage and festive occassions
19094,"types of rural credit credit needs of farmers may be classified as long-term credit these loans are required to acquire permanent assets like tractors, land, costly equipments, tube-wells, etc"
19095,these loans are for a period of 5 to 20 years
19096,"medium-term credit these loans are required for purchasing machinery, constructing fences and digging wells"
19097,such loans are generally stretch over a period of 12 months to 5 years
19098,"short-term credit these loans are required for buying seeds, tools, manure and fertilisers, etc"
19099,"this credit is given to the needy borrowers by cooperatives, moneylenders and banks"
19100,these loans are for a period of 6 to 12 months
19101,sources of rural credit credit in the rural sector is available from two sources 1
19102,"non-institutional sources of rural credit the major non-institutional sources of rural credit are moneylenders, friends, relatives, landlords, shopkeepers and commission agents"
19103,moneylenders provided about 93.6% of total financial requirement rural areas in 1951-52 and presently it is 30%
19104,"the short-term credit needs of the formers are met from commission agents, friends and relatives which supply roughly 50% of total rural borrowings, non-institutional sources of credit are not encouraged by government because of the following reasons they charge high rate of interest"
19105,the poor women’s bank kudumbashree is women-oriented community based poverty i reduction programme being implemented in kerala
19106,"in 1995, a thrift and credit society was started as a small savings for poor women with an objective to encourage savings"
19107,these societies have been acclaimed as largest informal banks in asia in terms of participation and savings mobilised
19108,"institutional sources of rural credit in regard to rural credit, major change occurred after 1969, when india adopted social banking and multi agency approach to adequately meet the needs of rural credit"
19109,the major institutional sources of rural credit are as follows (i) national bank for agriculture and rural development (nabard) it was set up in 1982 as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions involved in the rural financing system
19110,the rbi has contributed half of the share capital while the other half has been contributed by government of india
19111,the main functions of nabard are to grant long-term loans to the state government for subscribing to the share capital of cooperative societies
19112,"to take the responsibility of inspecting cooperative banks, regional rural banks (rrbs) and primary cooperative societies"
19113,to serve as a refinancing agency for the institutions providing finance to rural and agricultural development
19114,to help tenant farmers and small farmers to consolidate their land holdings
19115,the national agricultural credit fundjias been transferred from rbi to nabard to form a part of its national rural credit fund
19116,(ii) self help groups (shgs) formal credit system has proven inadequate
19117,"it has also not been fully integrated into the overall rural, social and community development"
19118,"due to the demand of some kind of collateral, vast proportion of poor rural households were automatically out of the credit networks"
19119,"self help groups emerged to fill this gap, created by formal credit system"
19120,self help groups (shgs) promote thrift in small proportions by a minimum contribution from each member
19121,"(iii) regional rural banks (rrbs) as a supplement to commercial banks, the regional rural banks have also been opened"
19122,these have been set up under the regional rural banks act-of 1976
19123,"their banking services are meant for small and marginal formers and artisans, etc"
19124,nearly 90% of the loan of rrbs were provided to the weaker section
19125,kisan credit card scheme kisan credit card scheme (kccs) was introduced by the government in 1998-99
19126,it facilitates access to credit from commercial banks and regional rural banks
19127,"under the scheme, the eligible farmers are provided with a kisan card and pass book from the relevent bank"
19128,the farmers can make withdrawls and repayments of cash within the credit limit as – specified in the kisan credit card (kcc)
19129,"(iv) commercial banks they were inducted into the field of agricultural credit under the banking reforms act, 1972"
19130,the share of commercial banks in the supply of agricultural credit has considerably improved
19131,"commercial banks disburse agricultural credit for the purchase of inputs, cattle, tractors, dairy farming, installation of tube-wells, etc"
19132,"(v) cooperative credit societies the cooperative credit societies are actively engaged in addressing credit needs of the farmers, besides offering a host of related services"
19133,notably these societies provide guidance in diverse agricultural operations with a view to raise crop productivity
19134,the main fimcdon of cooperative credit society is to provide timely and increased flow of credit to the farmers
19135,latest status of agricultural credit the following points reveal the latest status of agricultural credit the credit flow in this sector in 2011-12 is placed at rs
19136,the agricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme was announced in the union budget 2008-09
19137,farmers have been receiving crop loans upto a principal amount of rs.3 lakh at an effective rate of 4% per annum
19138,"to provide adequate and timely credit support to the formers, the kisan credit card (kcc) scheme was introduced in february, 1999"
19139,government is implementing a revival package for short-term rural cooperative credit structure involving financial outlay of rs
19140,"rural banking : a critical appraisal after the nationalisation of commercial banks in 1969, the rapid expansion of the banking system in rural areas has been witnessed"
19141,"rural banking has raised the level of rural farm and non-farm output, income and employment especially after the green revolution"
19142,advantages of rural banking raising farm and non-farm output by providing services and credit facilities to farmers
19143,achieving food security which is clear from the abundant buffer stocks of grains
19144,limitations of rural banking small and marginal formers receive only a very small portion of the institutional credit
19145,rural banking is suffering from the problems of large amount of over dues and default rate
19146,the sources of institutional finance are inadequate to meet the requirements of agricultural credit
19147,it is suggestible that more and more regional rural banks should be set up to need the credit need of the rural and backward areas of india
19148,"agricultural marketing, diversification of agricultural activities and organic fanning agricultural marketing agricultural marketing is the process that involves functions of assembling, storage, processing, packaging, transportation, grading and distribution of agricultural commodities throughout the country"
19149,"in other words, agricultural marketing covers the services involved in moving an agricultural product from the farm to the consumer"
19150,need of agriculture marketing need of agriculture marketing originates due to the problems faced by farmers
19151,different types of problems faced by the farmers are farmers while selling their produce to traders suffered from faulty weighing and manipulation of accounts
19152,"due to lack of knowledge about the prices prevailing in the markets, farmers are often forced to sell their produce at low prices"
19153,farmers did not have proper storage facilities to keep back their produce for selling later at better price
19154,approximately 10% of goods produced in farms is wasted due to lack of storage
19155,distress sale lack of agricultural marketing infrastructure often forces the farmers to sell their produce at low prices for fear of spoilage or to pay off an imminent debt
19156,"farmers tend to suffer highly on account of these sales, because they not only get a low price for their produce, but are also cheated by use of false weights and are charged a high commission"
19157,measures by government to improve agriculture marketing four measures which were initiated to improve the agriculture marketing aspect are discussed below 1
19158,regulation of markets the first measure to improve agriculture marketing aspect is regulation of markets to create orderly and transparent marketing conditions
19159,"regulated markets have been established where sale and purchase of the produce is monitored by the market committee consisting of representatives of government, farmers and the traders"
19160,market committee ensure that the formers get appropriate price of their produce
19161,"by and large, this policy benefited farmers as well as consumers"
19162,however there is still need to develop about 27000 rural periodic markets as regulated market places to realize the full potential of rural markets
19163,improvement in physical infrastructure it is the second measure to improve the agriculture marketing aspect
19164,"the current infrastructure facilities like; roads, railways, warehouses, godowns, cold storages and processing units etc are inadequate to meet the growing demand"
19165,cooperative marketing it is the third measure taken by government in realising the fair prices for farmers products
19166,"as members of these societies, formers find themselves better bargainers in the market and get better prices of their produce through collective sale"
19167,the success of milk cooperatives in gujarat and some other parts of the country are the brilliant examples of cooperative marketing
19168,different problems faced by cooperative during the recent past are inadequate coverage of former members
19169,supporting policies it is the fourth measure taken by government to improve agriculture marketing system
19170,different supportive policies applied in this regard are minimum support price (msp) it is an important step to improve agriculture market system
19171,"msp is an assurance to the farmers that a minimum price will be fixed by the government to formers’ produce, no purchasing can be done below this price, however farmers can sell their produce in open market above msp"
19172,maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice purchases from the farmers are kept by food corporation of india as buffer stocks
19173,distribution of foodgrains and sugars through stocks purchased by government at msp are used primarily for public distribution system (pds)
19174,distribution of foodgrains and other necessary items like kerosene oil at subsidised price to the poor takes place through fair price shops
19175,"emerging alternative marketing channels in india, alternative marketing channels are emerging"
19176,"through these channels, farmers directly sell their products to the consumers"
19177,this system increases farmers’ share in the prices paid by the consumers
19178,"important examples of such channels are apni mandi (punjab, haryana and rajasthan)"
19179,hadaspar mandi (pune); rythu bazars (vegetables and fruit market in andhra pradesh)
19180,several national and international fast food chains and hotels are also entering into contracts with the farmers to supply them farm products (fresh vegetables and fruits) of the desired quality
19181,diversification into productive activities diversification means a major proportion of the increasing labour force in the agricultural sector needs to find alternate employment opportunities in other non-farm sectors
19182,diversification is an emerging challenge in the context of rural development
19183,it has two aspects diversification of crop production diversification of productive activity diversification of crops this implies a shift from single cropping system to multi-cropping system
19184,"in india, where subsistence farming is still dominant, it may also mean a shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming"
19185,significance of diversification of crops diversification of crops is improtant because it will minimise the risk occuring
19186,"need of diversification into productive activities agriculture sector is a seasonal based activity, most of agriculture employment activities are concentrated in kharif season"
19187,"but during rabi season, in the areas where irrigation facilities are inadequate, it becomes difficult to find gainful employment"
19188,"so, there is a need to focus on allied activities, non farm employment and other emerging alternatives of livelihood"
19189,"also agriculture sector is already overcrowded, a major proportion of the increasing labour force needs to find alternate employment opportunities in other non-farm sectors"
19190,"animal husbandry in india, the forming community uses the mixed crop-live stock forming system"
19191,"livestock production provides increased stability in income, food security, transport, fuel and nutrition for the family without disrupting other food producing activities"
19192,"today, livestock sector alone provides alternate livelihood options to over 70 million small and marginal farmers including landless labourers"
19193,poultry accounts for the largest share with 55% followed by others
19194,a significant number of women also find employment in the livestock sector
19195,milk production in the country has increased by more thlkn five times between 1960-2009
19196,this can be attributed mainly to the successful implementation of ‘operation flood’
19197,"meat, eggs, wool and other by-products are also emerging as important productive sectors for diversification"
19198,"in numbers, our livestock population is quite impressive but its productivity is quite low as compared to other countries"
19199,it requires improved technology and promotion of good breeds of animals to enhance productivity
19200,improved veterinary care and credit facilities to small and marginal formers and landless labourers would enhance sustainable livelihood options through livestock production
19201,operation flood it is a system whereby all the farmers can pool their milk produced according to different grading (based on quality) and the same is processed and marketed to urban centres through cooperatives
19202,in this system farmers are assured of fair price and income from the supply of the milk to urban markets
19203,gujarat state is held as a success story in the efficient implementation of milk cooperatives which has been emulated by many states
19204,"fisheries the socio-economic status of fishermen is comparatively lower because of rampant underemployment low per capital earnings absence of mobility of labour to other sectors high rate of illiteracy indebtedness horticulture due to varying climate and soil conditions, india has adopted growing of diverse horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, tuber crops, flowers, medicinal and aromatic plants, spices and plantation crops"
19205,"these crops play an important role in providing food, nutrition and employment"
19206,"the period between 1991-2003 is called ‘golden revolution’ because during this period, the planned investment in horticulture became highly productive and the sector emerged as a sustainable livelihood option"
19207,"india has emerged as a world leader in producing a variety of fruits, like mangoes, bananas, coconuts, cashew, nuts and a number of species and is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables"
19208,economic conditions of many formers engaged in horticulture has improved and has become a means of improving livelihood for many unprivileged classes
19209,"flower harvesting, nursery maintance, hybrid seed production and tissue culture, propagation of fruits and flowers and food processing are highly profitable employment opportunities for rural women"
19210,it has been estimated that this sector provides employment to around 19% of the total labour force
19211,other alternate livelihood options the information technology (it) has revolutionised many sectors in the indian economy
19212,it plays a very significant role in achieving sustainable development and food security in the following ways it can act as a tool for releasing the creative potential and knowledge embedded in our people
19213,"issues like weather forecast, crop treatment, fertilisers, pestisides storage conditions, etc can be well administered, if expert opinion is made available to the farmers"
19214,"the quality and quantity of crops can be increased manifold, if the farmers are made aware of the latest equipments, technologies and resources"
19215,"every village a knowledge centre ms swaminathan research foundation, an institution located in chennai, tamil nadu, with support from sir ratan tata trust, mumbai, has established the jamshedji tata national virtual academy for rural prosperity"
19216,the academy envisaged to identify a million grass root knowledge workers who will b% enlisted as fellows of the academy
19217,"the programme provides an info-kiosk (pc with internet and video conferencing facility, scanner, photocopier, etc) at a low cost and trains kiosk owner; the owner then provides different services and tries to earn a reasonable income"
19218,the government of india has decided to join the alliance by providing financial support of rs
19219,"sustainable development and organic farming conventional agriculture uses chemical fertilisers and toxic pesticides, etc which enter the food supply, penetrate the water resources, harm the livestock, deplete the soil and devastate natural eco-system"
19220,"organic farming is such technology which restores, maintains and enhances the ecological balance"
19221,there is an increasing demand for organically grown food to enhance food safety throughout the world
19222,"benefits of organic farming organic forming substitutes costlier agriculture inputs like hyv seeds, chemical fertlisers, pesticides, etc with locally produced organic inputs that are cheaper and thereby generate good returns on investment"
19223,"organically grown food has more nutritional value than chemical forming, thus providing us with healthy foods"
19224,"due to more labour requirement in organic farming, it is an attractive proposition for india"
19225,limitations of organic farming yields from organic forming are less than modern agricultural forming in the initial years
19226,"therefore, small and marginal formers may find it difficult to adapt to large scale production"
19227,choice in production of off-season crops in quite limited in organic forming
19228,percentage of population having access to improved water sources-higher the better
19229,"with a view to accelerating the pace of growth, different countries are forming regional and global economic grouping based on common agreements of bilateral relations"
19230,common success story of india and pakistan a substantial rise in gdp per capita
19231,"common failures of india and pakistan relatively slow pace of gdp growth, compared with china"
19232,"sex ratio sex ratio is found to be low in all three countries pointing to social backwardness, where people hold high preference for a son in the family"
19233,open text based assessment (otba) will be based on this chapter
19234,nations are also eager to know and understand about the developmental process pursued by their neighbouring nations
19235,"in the process of globalisation, it is essential for every nation to compete with developed countries"
19236,"in this chapter, we are comparing the developmental strategies pursued by india with its neighbouring economies-pakistan and china"
19237,this will help in understanding where do we stand today in comparison to others
19238,"development strategies of india, china and pakistan india, china, pakistan have many similarities in their development strategies which are as follows india, pakistan and china have started towards their developmental path at the same time"
19239,all the three countries had started planning their development strategies in similar ways
19240,"india announced its five year plan in 1951-56, while ’ pakistan announced its first five year plan in 1956, which is called medium term plan"
19241,india and pakistan adopted similar strategies such as creating a large public sector and raising public expenditure on social development
19242,"till the 1980s, all the three countries had similar growth rates and per capita incomes"
19243,"reforms started in india in 1991, in china in 1978 and in pakistan in 1988"
19244,development strategies of india some of the prominent strategies of india are discussed below 1
19245,sound trade system india was a country which had the history of closed trade
19246,because of this historical background; there is a critical challenge for india in order to make a new policy which can support the new open trade system
19247,this new reform in economies of india has been introduced and accelerates the economic growth of india
19248,reduction in poverty india has adopted several poverty alleviation programmes to reduce poverty in india
19249,"-this would help in increasing per capita income, rise in nutrition level of poors and there is a subsequent fall in percentage of absolute poor in some states"
19250,"rural development under this strategy, india adopted various measures for the development of areas that are lagging behind in the overall development of village economy"
19251,employment generation several economic reforms were initiated to generate employment in the country and their aim is to provide gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities
19252,"development strategies of china after the establishment of people’s republic of china under one party rule, all the critical sectors of the economy, enterprises and lands owned and operated by individuals were brought under government control"
19253,certain development strategies of china are discussed below great leap forward (glf) this campaign initiated in 1958 aimed at industrialising the country on a massive scale
19254,"great proletarian cultural revolution (1966-76) in 1965, mao tse tung started a cultural revolution on a large scale"
19255,"in this revolution, students and professionals were sent to work and learn from the country side"
19256,"unlike glf, the cultural revolution did not have an explicit economic rationale"
19257,"1978 reforms since 1978, china began to introduce many reforms in phases"
19258,"the reforms were initiated in agriculture, foreign trade and investment sector"
19259,"in agriculture, lands were divided into small plots which were allocated to individual households"
19260,they were allowed to keep all income from the land after paying taxes
19261,"all enterprises which were owned and operated by local collectives in particular, were allowed to produce goods"
19262,"at this stage, enterprises owned by government (known as state board enterprises – soes), in india we call them public sector enterprises were made to face competition"
19263,"in reform, prices were fixed in two ways, i.e., farmers and industrial units were required to buy and sell fixed quantities of inputs and outputs on the basis of prices fixed by the government and the rest were purchased and sold at market prices"
19264,"over the years, as production increased, the proportion of goods or inputs transacted in the market also increased"
19265,the goal of chinese economic reforms was to generate sufficient surplus to finance the modernisation of the mainland chinese economy
19266,"in order to attract foreign investors, special economic zones (sezs) were set up"
19267,development strategies of pakistan the development strategies of pakistan are summarised below mixed economy pakistan follows a mixed economy system where both public and private sectors co-existed
19268,import substitution pakistan adopted a regulatory policy framework in the late 1950s and 1960s for import industrialisation
19269,the -policy combined tariff protection for manufacturing of consumer goods together with direct import controls on competing imports
19270,green revolution this was introduced to increase the productivity and self sufficiency in food
19271,pakistan shifted its policy orientation in 1970’s and 1980’s when private sector got encouragement
19272,and in 1988 certain reforms were also initiated in the country
19273,"success and failure of strategies the development strategies brought structural reforms in china, india and pakistan"
19274,follow the description of their success and failure one by one
19275,success of structural reforms in china the success of structural reforms in china are there was existence of infrastructure in the areas of education and health and land reforms
19276,"through the commune system, there was more equitable distribution of foodgrains"
19277,failures of structural reforms in china the failures of structural reforms in china are there was slow pace of growth and lack of modernisation in the chinese economy under the maoist rule
19278,"maoist vision of economic development based on decentralisation, self sufficiency and shunning of foreign technology had failed"
19279,"despite of extensive land reforms, collectivisation, the great leap forward and other initiatives, the per capita gain output in 1978 was the same as it was in the mid-1950s"
19280,"china has an edge over india the chinese reform process began more comprehensively during the 80s, when india was in the mid-stream of slow growth process"
19281,rural poverty in china declined by 85% during the period 1978 to 1989
19282,"in india, it declined only by 50% during this period, global exposure of the economy has been far more wider in china than in india"
19283,"china’s export-driven manufacturing has recorded on exponential growth, while india continues to be only a marginal player in the international markets"
19284,common success of structural reforms in india and pakistan the common success of structural reforms in india and pakistan are both india and pakistan have succeeded in more than doubling their per capita incomes inspite of high growth rate of population
19285,both the countries have achieved self-sufficiency in the production of food
19286,both the countries have succeeded in developing their service and industry sectors at a fast rate
19287,the use of modern technology is improving in both the countries
19288,common failures of structural reforms in india and pakistan the common failures of structural reforms in india and pakistan are growth rate of gdp and its sectoral constituents have fallen in 1990’s
19289,poverty and unemployment are still areas of major concerns in both the countries
19290,"areas where pakistan has an edge over india starting from almost the same level as india, pakistan has achieved better results with regards to migration of workforce from agriculture to industry, migration of people from rural to urban areas"
19291,"areas where india has an edge over pakistan there is little doubt that, in the area of skilled manpower and research and development institutions"
19292,"indian scientists excel in the areas of defence technology, space research, electronics and avionics, genetics, telecommunications, etc"
19293,the number of ph.ds produced by india in science and engineering every year (about 5000) is higher than the entire stock of ph.ds in pakistan
19294,issues of health facilities in general and infant mortality in particular are better addressed in india
19295,"demographic indicators we shall compare some demographic indicators of india, china and pakistan the population of pakistan is very small and accounts for roughly about one-tenth of china or india"
19296,"though china is the largest nation and geographically occupies the largest area among the three nations, its density is the lowest"
19297,one child norm was introduced in china in late 1970’s to check the problem of population growth
19298,"although sex ratio is biased against females in all three countries, in recent times, all three countries are trying to adopt various measures to improve the situation"
19299,after few decades there will be more elderly people in proportion to young people due to one child norm
19300,the fertility rate is low in china and very high in pakistan
19301,"gross domestic product and sectors according to the latest data available, we find (i) china has the second largest gdp (ppp) of us$ 10.1 trillion whereas, india’s gdp (ppp) is us $ 4.2 trillion and pakistan’s gdp (ppp) is 0.47 trillion us$; roughly about 10% of india’s gdp"
19302,"(ii) in 1980’s, pakistan was ahead of india, china was having double digit growth and india was at the bottom"
19303,"source key indicators for asia and pacific 2011, asian development bank, phillipines (iii) in 2000-10 there is a marginal decline in india and chinas growth rates whereas pakistan met with drastic decline in 4.7%"
19304,the reform processes introduced in 1988 in pakistan and political instability are reasons behind this trend
19305,(iv) china and pakistan have more proportion of urban people than india
19306,"(v) in china, due to topographic and climatic conditions, the area suitable for cultivation is relatively small-only about 10% of its total land area"
19307,the total cultivable area in china accounts for 40% of the cultivable area in india
19308,"(vi) until the 1980s, more than 80% of the people in china were dependent on farming as their sole source of livelihood"
19309,"(vii) the government encouraged people to leave their fields and pursue other activities such as handicrafts, commerce and transport"
19310,"(viii) in 2008, with 40% of its workforce engaged in agriculture, its contribution to gdp in china is 10%"
19311,"(ix) in both india and pakistan, the contribution of agriculture to gdp was at 19 and 21% respectively"
19312,but the proportion of workforce that works in this sector is more in india
19313,"in pakistan, about 45% of people work in agriculture whereas in india it is 56%"
19314,"(x) the sectoral share of output and employment also shows that in all the three economies, the industry and service sectors have less proportion to workforce but contribute more in terms of output"
19315,"(xi) in china, manufacturing contributes the highest to gdp at 47% whereas in india and pakistan, it is the service sector which contributes the highest"
19316,"in both these countries, service sector accounts for more than 50% of gdp"
19317,"in the normal course of development, countries first shift their employment and output from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services"
19318,the proportion of workforce engaged in manufacturing in india and pakistan were low at 49 and 20% respectively
19319,(xii) the contribution of industries to gdp is also just equal to or marginally higher than the output from agriculture
19320,"in india and pakistan, the shift is taking place directly to the service sector"
19321,"(xiii) thus, in both india and pakistan, the service sector is emerging as a major player of development"
19322,"it contributes more to gdp and, at the same time, emerges as a prospective employer"
19323,"(xiv) in the 1980s india, china and pakistan employed 17, 12 and 27% of its workforce in the service sector respectively"
19324,"in 2008-10 it has reached the level of 25, 33 and 35% respectively"
19325,"human development indicator india, china and pakistan have performed in some of the selected indicators of human development"
19326,"some selected indicators of human development, 2009-10 source human development report 2011 and world development indicators (www.worldbank.org) from the data we would be able to conclude china is moving ahead of both india and pakistan in terms of indicators of human development"
19327,"pakistan is ahead of india in reducing proportion of people below the poverty line and also its performance in education, sanitation and access to water is better than that of india"
19328,"in china, for one lakh births, only 38 women die whereas, in india 230 women die and in pakistan 260 women die"
19329,india is in the worst scenario as compared to the other two countries with respect to access to improved sanitation and clean water
19330,"human development index (hpi) hdi includes quantitative aspects of per capital, gdp and the quality aspects of performance in"
19331,"it is an average of life expectancy index, education index and gdp index"
19332,"relative poverty it refers to poverty in relation to different classes, regions or countries"
19333,"absolute poverty in india, concept of poverty line is used as a measure of absolute poverty"
19334,poverty line it is that line which expresses per capita average monthly expenditure by which people can satisfy their minimum needs
19335,relative poverty and absolute poverty are the two variants of poverty
19336,poverty line is fixed in india  in the estimation of consumption cut off
19337,each frequency counts the number of heads belonging to a particular consumption class
19338,"categorising poverty category 1 chronic poor those who are always poor and those who are usually poor e.g., landless workers"
19339,category 2 transient poor those who are moving in and out of poverty and occasionally poor
19340,rural poor these include landless agricultural work marginal holders and tenants-at-will
19341,"urban poor these include migrants from the rural areas in search of employment, casual factory workers and self employed serving largely as street vendors"
19342,urban poor are largely the spillover of the rural poor who are forded to migrate in search of jobs
19343,causes of poverty low level of national product low rate of growth heavy pressure of population inflationary pressures chronic unemployment and under employment capital deficiency outdated social institutions lack of infrastructure measures to remove poverty combating poverty by accelerating the place of economic growth
19344,poverty alleviation programmes some of the principle measures adopted by the government to remove poverty are given below samaranjayanti gram swarozgar yojana (sgsy) sampoorna gramin rozgar yojana (sgry) pradanmantri gramoday yojana (pgy) jai prakash rozgar guarantee yojana (jprgy) the swaran jayanti shahri rozgar yojana (sjsry) prime minister’s rozgar yojana development of small and cottage industries (viii) minimum needs programme twenty point programme mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee question 1
19345,answer: the government uses monthly per capita expenditure (mpce) as proxy for income of households to identify the poor
19346,poverty line is estimated by the monetary value (per capita expenditure) of the minimum calorie intake that was estimated at 2400 calories for a rural person and 2100 for a person in the urban area
19347,but this calorie-based norm is not adequate to identify the poor due to following reasons this mechanism groups all the poor together and does not differentiate between the very poor and the other poor which makes it difficult to identify who amongst them needs help the most
19348,"economists question, the basis of taking expenditure on food and a few select items as proxy for income"
19349,"this norm does not take into account the other factors associated with poverty such as accessibility to basic education, health care, drinking water and sanitation"
19350,"this norm does not take social factors such as illiteracy, lack of access to resources, discrimination or lack of civil and political freedoms into consideration"
19351,"answer: the national food for work programme was launched in november 2004 in 150 most backward districts of the country, identified by the planning commission in consultation with the ministry of rural development and the state governments"
19352,"the objective of the programme was to provide additional resources apart from the resources available under the sampoorna grameen rozgar yojana to 150 most backward districts of the country so that generation of supplementary wage employment and providing of food security through creation of need based economic, social and community assets in these districts are further intensified"
19353,the scheme was 100 per cent centrally sponsored and was open to all rural poor who were in need of wage employment and wanted to do manual and unskilled work
19354,"the focus of the programme was on work relating to water conservation, drought proofing and land development"
19355,"flood control protection, rural connectivity in terms of all-weather roads and any other similar activity for economic sustainability could be included"
19356,foodgrains were given as part of wages under the nffwp to the rural poor at the rate of 5 kg per man day and the remaining portian may be given in cash
19357,more than 5 kg foodgrains can be given to the labourers under this programme in exceptional cases subject to a minimum of 25% of wages to be paid in cash
19358,"the programme has now been subsumed in nationai rural employment guarantee act, which has come in force in 200 identified districts of the country including 150 nffwp districts"
19359,why are employment generation programmes important in poverty alleviation in india
19360,poverty alleviation has been one of the guiding principles of the planning process in india
19361,poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start contributing to growth by their active involvement in the growth process
19362,following points discussed the importance of employment generation programmes to eradicate poverty
19363,nexus between unemployment and poverty there exists a deep nexus between unemployment and poverty
19364,"if employment opportunities are generated, then more people will be employed leading to rise in their income which in turn will reduce poverty"
19365,"availability of basic facilities with the rise in employment opportunities, income increases and poor people are able to get access to education, health facilities, proper sanitation etc"
19366,"creation of assets the employment generation programmes aim at creation of assets like water harvesting, irrigation facilities, construction of roads, construction of dams etc"
19367,all these assets help in the social and economic development of the rural areas and hence eradication of poverty
19368,creation of skills an essential element of employment generation programmes is the formation of human capital by imparting skills to the unskilled labourers through training
19369,"thus, such poverty alleviation programmes like prime minister’s rozgar yojana, swarna jayanti shahari rogzar yojana, national food for work programme, annapurna are came into an existence"
19370,how can creation of income earning assets address the problem of poverty
19371,answer: the problem of poverty cannot be solved by giving foodgrains to the poor or distributing clothes to them as no government can keep doing these activities for long due to lack of resources
19372,poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start rning for themselves and in turn contribute to growth by their active involvement in the growth process
19373,"this is possible by providing income generating assets to the poor in the form of land for agriculture, tools and instruments to set up self employment units and giving them proper training which will enhance their income earning capacity"
19374,this can help pbor people to participate in economic activities and make them empowered
19375,"this will also help create employment opportunities which may lead to increase in levels of income, skill development, health and literacy and thus poor can be assured of income per month which will help him to come above the poverty line"
19376,the three dimensional attack on poverty adopted by the government has not succeeded in poverty alleviation in india
19377,"answer: poverty alleviation has always been accepted as one of the major objectives of planned development process in india but even after vast spending on poverty alleviation programmes, the government has not succeeded in poverty alleviation in india"
19378,"despite various strategies to alleviate poverty, problems like hunger, malnourishment, illiteracy and lack of basic amenities are prevalent in india"
19379,"none of the poverty alleviation strategies resulted in any radical change in the ownership of assets, process of production and improvement of basic amenities to the needy"
19380,"due to unequal distribution of assets, the benefits from poverty alleviation programmes have not actually reached the poor"
19381,the amount of resources allocated for the poverty alleviation programmes is not sufficient when we take the magnitude of poverty into consideration
19382,"the implementation of the poverty alleviation programmes is the responsibility of government and bank officials who are ill motivated, inadequately trained, corruption prone and vulnerable to pressure from local elites"
19383,government policies have also failed to address the various issues related to poverty due to non-participation of local level institutions in programme implementation
19384,it is evident that high growth alone is not sufficient to reduce poverty without the active participation of the people
19385,"further, it is necessary to identify poverty stricken areas and provide infrastructure such as schools, roads, power, telecom, it services, training institutions etc"
19386,institutional weaknesses abound and implementation failure are the biggest reasons that these programmes not succeeded
19387,what programmes has the government adopted to help the elderly people and poor and destitute women
19388,"answer: in accordance with the directive principles of state policy, the government of india introduced national social assistance programme (nsap) in 1995 to help the elderly people and poor and destitute women"
19389,the nsap aims at ensuring minimum national standard for social assistance in addition to the benefits that states are currently providing or would provide in future
19390,"at present, nsap comprises of the following five schemes for bpl persons indira,gandhi national old age pension scheme (ignoaps) indira gandhi national widow pension scheme (ignwps) indira gandhi national disability pension scheme (igndps) national family benefit scheme (nfbs) annapurna under indira gandhi national old age pension scheme (ignoaps), f 200 per month provided to the beneficiary of age 65 or more and belonging to a bpl family according to criteria prescribed by government of india"
19391,widow pension is provided under ignwps to the bpl widows of age group of 40-64 years
19392,disability pension is provided to the multiple or severely disabled persons of age group of 18-64 years under igndps
19393,"central assistance of ₹ 200 per month per beneficiary is provided under indira gandhi national disability pension scheme (igndps) and indira gandhi , national widow pension scheme (ignwps)"
19394,the states are urged to contribute another ₹ 200 from their own resources so that a pensioner could get at least ₹ 400 per month in the above programmes
19395,unemployment or under employment and the casual and intermittent nature of work in both rural and urban areas drives unemployed people who do not have resources to make their ends meet into indebtedness and poverty
19396,"if employment opportunities are generated, then more people will be employed leading to rise in their income which in turn will reduce poverty"
19397,"due to unemployment, income of the people is reduced to a large extent and they are unable to get access to education, health facilities, proper sanitation, etc"
19398,this causes poor quality of living and hence poor human capital and skills which in turn lead to poverty making a vicious circle of poverty
19399,suppose you are from a poor family and you wish to get help from the government to set up a petty shop
19400,answer: we can apply for assistance to set up a petty shop under prime minister rozgar yojana (pmry) because the educated unemployed from low income families in rural and urban areas can get financial help to set up any kind of enterprise that generates employment under pmry
19401,is it correct to say that poverty has shifted from rural to urban areas
19402,answer: the difference between rural and urban poverty is mainly of the nature of poverty.’ the poor are identified on the basis of their occupation and ownership of assets
19403,"the rural poor work mainly as landless agricultural labourers, cultivators with very small landholdings, landless labourers who are engaged in a variety of non-agricultural jobs and tenant cultivators with small landholdings"
19404,"on the other hand, the urban poor are largely the overflow of the rural poor who had migrated to urban areas in search of alternative employment and livelihood, labourers who do a variety of casual jobs and the self-employed who sell a variety of things on roadsides and are engaged in various activities"
19405,it can be seen from the following table showing the trends in poverty ratio that poverty has shifted from rural to urban areas
19406,it is evident from the above table that rural poverty has declined significantly from 56.4% in 1973-74 to 28.3% in 2004-05 whereas decline in urban poverty (from 49% to 25.7%) is not that significant
19407,"moreover, the gap between the rural and urban poverty ratios which was around 7% in 1973-74 fell to just around 2% in 2004-05 again signifying the shift in poverty from rural to urban areas"
19408,"suppose you are a resident of a village, suggest a few measures to tackle the problem of poverty"
19409,"answer: as a resident of a village, a few measures which i would suggest to alleviate poverty from rural areas are as follows identified the poorest who is in the most urgent need of assistance"
19410,implementation of poverty alleviation programmes should be done by involving the village panchayat and local people
19411,focus of schemes should be more on providing income generating asset
19412,vocational training should be provided to the youth to enable them to earn their livelihood
19413,improved delivery mechanism should be put in place in schools so that the level of education is brought up to the required standards
19414,credit facilities through banks and micro finance institutions should be provided to the people to save them from indebtedness to the exploitative moneylenders
19415,"farmers should be provided land for cultivation and irrigation, warehousing and marketing facilities should be provided to small farmers"
19416,targeted public distribution system (pds) should be adopted to provide food security to bpl families
19417,committed government officials should be given the responsibility of rural development programmes
19418,infrastructure impacts productivity infrastructure induces investment infrastructure generates linkages in production infrastructure enhances size of the market enhance ability to work induces foreign direct invesment (fdi) the state of infrastructure in india (i) energy energy is the most important component of economic infrastructure
19419,"(ii) conventional sources coal natural gas (iii) non-conventional sources solar energy wind energy biomass energy including energy in the form of gobar gas geo thermal energy energy through tides and waves as well as temperatue gradient over sea (iv) power/electricity the most visible form of energy, which is often identified with progress in moderation civilization is power, commonly called electricity"
19420,"(v) some challenges in the power sector inadequate generation of electricity less capacity utilisation losses of electricity boards (vi) health health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being"
19421,it does not simply mean absence of disease; rather it means a sound physical and mental state of the individual
19422,development of health services after independence there has been a large scale improvement in health facilities
19423,"following are the highlights decline in death rate reduction in infant mortality rise in expectancy of life control over deadly diseases reduction in child mortality rate women’s health women in india suffer from a serious neglect not only in the area of education, but in the area of health care as well"
19424,more than 50% of women in india in the age group of 15-49 years suffer from nutritional deficiency
19425,health as an emerging challenge points given below highlight the deficiencies of our social infrastructure in terms of health facilities
19426,unequal distribution of healthcare services communicable diseases poor management privatisation poor upkeep and maintenance poor sanitation level infrastructure facilitates support system in an economy
19427,it contributes to economic development of a country both by rising the productivity of factors of production and by improving the quality of life of its people
19428,this chapter focuses on analysing the economic and social components of infrastructure
19429,the significance of infrastructure in the context of growth and development of an economy is also discussed in it
19430,"concept, types and importance of infrastructure infrastructure is basic physical and organisational structure needed for the operation of a society or enterprise"
19431,"it provides supporting services in the main areas of industrial and agricultural production, domestic and foreign trade and commerce"
19432,infrastructural installations do not direcdy produce goods but help in promoting production activities in an economy
19433,"these services include roads, railways, ports, airports, dams, power stations, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunication facilities, etc"
19434,"they also include country’s educational system including schools and colleges, health system including hospitals, sanitary system including clean drinking water facilities and the monetary system including banks, insurance and other financial institutions"
19435,types of infrastructure infrastructure is broadly categorised as social and economic infrastructure
19436,they are discussed below social infrastructure it refers to the core elements of social change which serve as a foundation for the process of social development of a country
19437,"it contributes to economic processes indirectly and from outside the system of production and distribution, e.g"
19438,economic infrastructure it refers to all such elements of economic change which serve as a foundation for the process of economic growth
19439,difference between social and economic infrastructure relevance of infrastructure infrastructure is the support system which provides support to the efficient working of a modem industrial economy
19440,"modem agriculture also largely depends on it for speedy and large scale transportation of seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, etc"
19441,"in recent times, agriculture also depends on insurance and banking system"
19442,"improvements in water supply and – sanitation have a large impact by reducing morbidity (state of being unhealthy or diseased) from major waterborne diseases and reducing the severity of disease, when it occurs"
19443,air pollution and safety hazards connected to transportation also effect morbidity particularly in densely populated areas
19444,"importance of infrastructure in development folloiving points highlights how exactly infrastructure contributes to the process of growth and development impact on productivity infrastructure plays an major role in the raising productivity, with improved roadways, warehouses etc farmers can easily sell their products in different markets"
19445,"also irrigation facilities has reduced dependence on monsoon for water needs, which not only increases productivity but also production level"
19446,low investment points to low level of production and backwardness of an economy
19447,"generates linkages in production better means of transport and communication, robust system of banking and finance generates better inter-industrial linkages"
19448,it is a situation when expansion of one industry facilitates the expansion of the other
19449,enhances size of the market infrastructure enhances the size of the market as large scale of production can capture more market
19450,"enhances ability to work social infrastructure increases the quality of life of workers, thereby increasing their efficiency"
19451,"health care centres, educational institutions and other such facilities inherit skills which increases ability and efficiency to work"
19452,facilities outsourcing india is emerging to be a global destination for all kinds of outsourcing
19453,"for example, call centres, study centres, medical transcription and such other services, owing largely – to its sound system of social and economic infrastructure"
19454,"the state of infrastructure in india traditionally, the government has been solely responsible for developing the country’s infrastructure"
19455,but it was found that the government’s investment in infrastructure was inadequate
19456,"today, the private sector by itself and also in joint partnership with the public sector has started playing a very important role in infrastructure development"
19457,"india invests only 5% of its gdp on infrastructure, which is for below than that of china and indonesia"
19458,infrastructure state in rural area majority of india’s population still lives in rural area
19459,"infrastructure state in rural india can be understood from the following points despite of so much technological progress, women of rural india are still using bio fuels to meet their daily energy requirement"
19460,women go long distances to fetch water and other basic needs
19461,"the census 2001 shows that in rural india, only 56% households have an electricity connection and 43% still use kerosene"
19462,about 90% of the rural households use bio fuels for cooking
19463,"about 76% of the population drinks water from open resources such as wells, ponds, etc"
19464,"future prospects in india some economists have projected that india will become the third biggest economy in the world, a few decades from now"
19465,"for that to happen, india will have to boost its infrastructure investment"
19466,"in an economy as the income rises, requirement of infrastructure will change"
19467,"for low income countries, basic infrastructure services like irrigation, transport and power are more important"
19468,on the contrary the developed economies require more service related to infrastructure
19469,"that is why, share of power and telecommunication infrastructure is greater in high income countries"
19470,"thus, development of infrastructure and economic development go hand in hand"
19471,"obviously, if proper attention is not paid to infrastructure development, economic development will be severely affected"
19472,"in this chapter, we will focus only two kinds of infrastructure, those associated with energy and health"
19473,energy energy is a critical aspect of development process of a nation
19474,"it is essential for industries, agriculture and related areas like production and transportation of fertilisers, pesticides and farm equipment"
19475,"it is also required in house for cooking, household lighting and heating etc"
19476,"conventional sources of energy there are two types of conventional sources of energy commercial sources coal, petroleum and electricity are commercial sources of energy as they bought and sold in the market"
19477,they account for over 40% of total energy sources consumed in india
19478,"non-commercial sources fire wood, agricultural waste and dried dung non-commercial sources of energy"
19479,more then 60% of indian households depend on the traditional sources of energy
19480,"non-conventional sources of energy solar energy, wind energy and tidal power are non-conventional sources"
19481,india has almost unlimited potential for producing all three types of energy if some appropriate cost effective technologies (that are already available) are used
19482,difference between conventional and non-conventional sources of energy conventional sources of energy these are the traditional sources of energy which are generally bought and sold in the market
19483,"in india, conventional sources are being used in total disregard to the environment, i.e"
19484,primary and final sources of energy primary sources they are those sources which are the gift of nature to the earth
19485,"this involves transformation process, transforming inputs into final outputs like transformation of coal energy into electricity"
19486,"consumption pattern of commercial energy in india at present, commercial energy consumption makes up about 74% of the total energy consumed in india"
19487,"this includes coal with the largest share of 54%, followed by oil at 33%, natural gas at 9% and hydro energy at 3%"
19488,non-commercial energy sources account for over 26% ofthe total energy consumption
19489,"the critical feature of india’s energy sector and its linkages to the economy, is the import dependence on crude and petroleum products, which is likely to grow rapidly to more than 100% of the need in the near future"
19490,"sectoral pattern of energy consumption in india earlier till 1953-54, transport sector was the largest consumer of commercial energy but it declined thereafter and industrial sector has been increasing"
19491,the share of oil and gas is highest among all commercial energy consumption
19492,"power/electricity the most visible form of energy, which is often identified with progress in modern civilisation, is power, commonly called electricity"
19493,it is a critical component of infrastructure that determines the economic development of a country
19494,the growth rate of demand for power is generally higher than the gdp growth rate
19495,"studies point that in order to have 8% per annum, power supply needs to grow around 1"
19496,"in 2010-11, thermal sources accounted for almost 65% generation capacity in india"
19497,hydel and wind power accounted for 32.5% while nuclear power accounted only 2.5%
19498,"india’s energy policy encourages two energy sources; hydel and wind, as they do not rely on fossil fuel and hence, avoid carbon emissions and are renewable in nature"
19499,it has resulted in faster growth of electricity produced from there two sources
19500,"at present, nuclear energy accounts for only 2.5% of total energy consumption, against a global average of 13% which is too low"
19501,"hence, some scholars suggest to generate more electricity through atomic sources"
19502,use of solar energy in thane there is a use of solar energy on large scale in thane city
19503,"the use of solar energy, which was considered a somewhat far fetched concept, has bought in real benefits and results in cost and energy saving, in this city, solar energy is being applied to heat water, power traffic signals and advertising hoardings, the experiment is lead by thane municipal corporation"
19504,it has made compulsory for all new buildings in the city to install solar water heating system
19505,"some challenges in the power sector energy, in a developing country like india, is a basic put required to sustain economic growth and to provide basic amenities of life to the entire population of a country"
19506,"energy generated at various power stations is not totally used by the consumers, some of it is consumed by the power station itself and some of it is wasted in transmission"
19507,"some of the challenges that india’s power sector faces today are india’s installed capacity to generate electricity is , not sufficient to feed an annual economic growth of 9%"
19508,"at present, india is able to and only 20,000 mw a year"
19509,"state electricity boards (sebs) which distribute electricity, incur losses which exceed"
19510,"500 billion due to transmission and loss in distribution, wrong pricing of electricity and other inefficiences"
19511,"private sector power generators are yet to play their role in a major way, same is the case with foreign investors"
19512,there is general public unrest due to high power tariffs and prolonged power cuts in different parts of the country
19513,"thermal power plants which are the mainstay of india’s power sector, are facing shortage of raw material and coal supplies"
19514,continued economic development and raising population is driving the demand for more energy than what india is currendy producing
19515,"instead of investing in already installed power sector, government has shifted interest into the private sector particularly for the distribution of electricity at much higher prices"
19516,"power distribution : the case of delhi since, independence power management in the capital has changed hands four times"
19517,the delhi state electricity board (dseb) was set up in 1951
19518,this was succeeded by the delhi electric supply undertaking (desu) in 1958
19519,the delhi vidyut board (dvb) came into existence as seb in february 1997
19520,now the distirbutioq of electricity vests with two leading private sector companies—reliance energy limited (bses rajdhani power limited and bses yamuna power limited) and tata—power limited (tpddl)
19521,the tariff structure and other regulatory issues are monitored by the delhi electricity regulatory commission (derc)
19522,"though it was expected that there will be greater improvement in power distribution and the consumers will benefit in a major way, experience shows unsatisfactory results"
19523,health a person’s ability to work depends largely on his health
19524,health is not only absence of disease but also the ability to realise one’s potential
19525,it is the holistic process related to the overall growth and development of the nation
19526,"scholars assess people’s health by taking into account indicators like infant mortality and maternal mortality rate, life expectancy and nutrition levels, alongwith incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases"
19527,development of health infrastructure ensures a country about healthy manpower for production of goods and services
19528,"health infrastructure includes hospitals, doctors, nurses and other para-medical professionals, beds, equipment required in hospitals and a well developed pharmaceutical industry"
19529,only the presence of infrastructure is not enough to have healthy people but it should be accessable to all the people easily
19530,"state of health infrastructure in india the government has the constitutional obligation to guide and regulate all health related issues such as medical education, adulteration of food, drugs and poisons, medical profession, vital statistics, mental, deficiency and lunacy"
19531,"central council of health and family welfare collects information and renders financial and technical assistance to state governments, union territories and other bodies for implementation of important health programmes in the country"
19532,"state of health infrastructure in india can be understood from the following points at the village level, a variety of hospitals known as primary health centres (phcs) have been set"
19533,"there are large number of hospitals run by voluntary agencies and the private sector, equipped with professionals and para medicaf professionals trained in medical, pharmacy and nursing colleges"
19534,"since independence, there has been a significant expansion in the physical provision of health services"
19535,"private sector health, infrastructure is explained below about 70% of the hospitals running in india belong to private sector"
19536,nearly 60% of dispensaries are run by the same private sector
19537,"private sector has also been contributing significantly in medical education and training, medical technologies and diagnostics, manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals, hospital construction and medical services"
19538,health system in india india’s health infrastructure and healthcare is made up of a three tier system 1
19539,"primary healthcare primary healthcare system in india includes education concerning prevailing health problems and methods of identifying, preventing and controlling them"
19540,promotion of food supply and proper nutrition and adequate supply of water and basic sanitation
19541,auxiliary nursing midwife (anm) is the first person who provides primary healthcare
19542,"primary health centres (phcs), community health centres (chcs) and sub centres"
19543,"secondary healthcare when condition of a patient is not managed by phcs, they are referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals"
19544,"health care institutes having better facilities for surgery, x-ray, ecg (electro cardio graph) are called secondary healthcare institutes"
19545,they function both as primary health care provider and also provide better health care facilities
19546,they are mostly located in district and headquarters in big towns
19547,"tertiary healthcare in tertiary sector, there are the hospitals which have advanced level equipment and medicines and undertake all the complicated health problems, which could not be managed by primary and secondary hospitals"
19548,this sector also includes many premier institutes which not only impart quality medical education and conduct research but also provide specialised health care
19549,"for example, all india institute of medical sciences (aiimss), post graduate institute (pgi), chandigarh, jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research (jipmer), pondicherry, national institute of mental health and neuro sciences (nimhnss), banglore and all india institute of hygiene and public health, kolkata"
19550,"indian systems of medicine asm it includes six systems, ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha, naturopathy and homeopathy (ayusnh)"
19551,at present there are 3529 ism hospitals 24943 dispensaries and as 6.5 lakhs registered practitioners in india
19552,"medical tourism – a great opportunity now-a-days foreigners visit india for surgeries,liver transplants, dental and even cosmetic care etc, the reason is, our health gervices combine latest medical technologies with qualified professionals and is cheaper for foreigners as compared to costs of similar health careaervices in their own countries"
19553,"in 2004-05, as many as 150000 foreigners visited india for medical treatment, this figure is likely to increase by 15% each year"
19554,health infrastructure can be upgraded to attract more foreigners to india
19555,"ism has huge potential and can solve a large part of our health care problems because they are effective, safe, and inexpensive"
19556,"indicators of health an health infrastructure :critical appraisal (i) health status of the country can be assessed through indicators such as infant mortality and maternal mortality rates, life expectancy and nutrition levels, alongwith the incidence of communicable diseases"
19557,iholars argue that there is greater scope for the role of government in the health sector
19558,"www.worldbank.org from the given table, following facts can be concluded india’s expenditure on health sector is only 4.2% of total gdp"
19559,"this is very low as compared to other countries, both developing and developed"
19560,india has about 17% of the world’s population but it bears a frightening 20% of the global burden of diseases
19561,global burden of diseases (gbd) is an indicator used by experts to gauge the number of people dying prematurely due to a particular disease as well as the number of years spent by them in state of‘disability’ owing to the disease
19562,every year around five lakh children die due to water borne diseases
19563,malnutrition and inadequate supply of vaccines lead to the death of 2.2 million children every year
19564,"at present, less than 20% c the population utilises public health facilities"
19565,"only 38% of phc’s, have quired number of doctors and only 30% of phc’s have suttk stock of medicines"
19566,urban-rural and poor-rich divide differences in medical healthcare between urban – rural and poor-rich can be understood from the points given below only one-fifth of total hospitals are located in rural areas
19567,"out of 7 lakhs beds, roughly 11% are available in rural areas"
19568,there are only 0.36% hospital for every one lakh people in rural areas while urban areas have 3.6% hospitals for the same number of people
19569,"the phcs located in rural areas do not offer even x-ray or blood testing facilities which, for a city dweller, constitutes basic healthcare"
19570,"even though 315 recognised medical colleges produce 30,000 medical graduates every year"
19571,one-fifth of these doctors migrate from one coutry to -another for better job opportunities
19572,the poorest 20% of indians living in both urban and rural areas spend 12% of their income on healthcare while the rich spend only 2%
19573,percentage of people who have no access to proper care has risen from 15 in 1986 to 24 in 2003
19574,women’s health women constitute about half the total population in india
19575,"they suffer many disadvantages as compared to men in the areas of education, participation in economic activities and health care"
19576,the child sex ratio has been detonated from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011
19577,"close to 300000 girls under the age of 15 are not only married but have already borne children, at least once"
19578,more than 50% of married women between the age group of 15 and 49 years suffer from anaemia caused by iron deficiency
19579,abortions are major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in india
19580,health : a vital public good and a basic human right all citizens can get better health facilities if public health services are decentralised
19581,so it is necessary to create awareness on health and provide efficient system
19582,the role of telecom and it in this regard is very important
19583,the ultimate goal should be to help people move towards a better quality of life
19584,primary source of data it implies collection of data from its source of origin
19585,secondary source of data it implies collection of data from some agency or institution which already happens to have collected the data through statistical survey
19586,"types of data there are two types of data primary data data collected by the investigator for his own purpose for the first time, from beginning to end are called primary data"
19587,"secondary data these data have already been collected by somebody else, these are available in the form of published or unpublished report"
19588,"principal differences between primary and secondary data primary data are original and secondary data are already in existence and therefore, are not original"
19589,"primary data do not need any adjustment, secondary data need to be adjustment to suit the objective of study in hand"
19590,statistical methods of data collection (i) direct personal investigation it is the method by which data are personally collected by the investigator from the information
19591,(a) merits originality reliability uniformity accuracy related information elastic (b) demerits difficult to cover wide areas costly personal bias limited coverage (ii) indirect oral investigation it is the method by which information is obtained not from the persons regarding whom the information is needed
19592,it is collected orally from other persons who are expected to possess the necessary information
19593,"merits and demerits of this method are given below (a) merits wide coverage expert opinion simple less expensive free from bias (b) demerits less accurate doubtful conclusions biased (iii) information from local sources or correspondents under this method, the investigator appoints local persons or correspondents at different places"
19594,merits and demerits of this method are given below (a) merits economical wide coverage continuity suitable for special purpose (b) demerits loss of originality lack of uniformity personal bias less accurate delay in collection (iv) information through questionnaries and schedules there are two ways of collecting information on the basis of questionnaire (a) mailing method under this method questionnaires are mailed to the informants
19595,the method is most suited when the area of the study is very wide
19596,(b) enumerator’s methods under this method enumerator himself fills the schedules after seeking information from the informants
19597,this method is mostly used when field of investigation is large
19598,the investigators are well versed in the local language and cultural norms of the informants
19599,"(c) collection of secondary data there are two main sources of secondary data published sources unpublished sources (d) published sources some of the published source of secondary data are government publication semi-government publication reports of committees and commissions publications of trade associations publication of research institutions journals and papers publication of research scholars international publication (e) unpublished sources these data are collected by the government organisations and others, generally for their self use or office record"
19600,"in order to assess the reliability, suitability and adequacy of the data, the following points must be kept in mind ability of the collecting organisation objective and scope method of collection time and condition of organisation definition of the unit accuracy (v) census ‘method census method is that method in which data are collected covering every item of the universe or population relating to the problem under investigation"
19601,merits and demerits of this method are given follows (a) merits reliable and accurate less biased extensive information study of diverse characteristic study of complex investigation indirect investigation (b) demerits costly large manpower not suitable for large investigation (vi) sample method it is that method in which data is collected about the sample on a group of items taken from the populations for examination and conclusions are drawn on their basis
19602,merits and demerits of this method are given below (a) merits economical time saving identification of error large investigation administrative convenience more scientific (b) demerits partial wrong conclusions difficulty in selecting representative sample difficulty in framing a sample specialised knowledge methods of sampling (i) random sampling random sampling is that method of sampling in which each and every item of the universe has equal chance of being selected in the sample
19603,random sampling may be done in any of the following ways lottery method tables of random number (ii) purposive or deliberate sampling it is that method in which the investigator himself makes the choice of the samples items which in his opinion are the best representative of the universe
19604,"(iii) stratified or mixed sampling according to this method of sampling population is divided into different strata having different characteristics and some of the items are selected from each strata, so the entire population gets represented"
19605,"(iv) systematic sampling according to this methods, units of the population are numerically, geographically and alphabetically arranged"
19606,every nth item of the numbered is selected as a sample item
19607,"(v) quota sampling in this method, the population is divided into different groups or classes according to different characteristics of the population"
19608,"(vi) convenience sampling in this method, sampling is done by the investigator in such a manner that suits his convenience"
19609,reliability of sampling data it depends mainly on the following factors size of the sample method of sampling bias of correspondents and enumerators training of enumerators important agencies at the national level which collect process and tabulate the statistical data
19610,"nsso (national sample survey organisation), rgi (registrar general of india), dgcis (directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics) and labour bureaus"
19611,"positive correlation when two variables move in the same direction, such a relation is called positive correlation, e.g., relationship between price and supply negative correlation when two variables changes in different directions, it is called negative correlation"
19612,degree of correlation degree of correlation refers to the coefficient of correlation (ii) absence of correlation (iii) limited degree of correlation the degree of correlation between 0 and 1 may be rated as high (0.75 and 1) moderate (0.25 and 0.75) low (0 and 0.25) methods of estimating correlation (i) scatter diagram scattered diagram offers a graphic expression of the direction and degree of correlation
19613,karl pearson’s coefficient of correlation this is also known as product moment correlation and simple correlation coefficient
19614,karl pearson has given a quantitative method of calculating correlation karl pearson’s coefficient correlation is generally written as v
19615,"formula according to karl pearson’s method, the coefficient of correlation is measured as \(r=\frac{\sigma x y}{n \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}\) where, r = coefficient of correlation; x = x – \(\overline{x}\) y= y – \(\overline{y}\) σx = standard deviation of x series σy = standard deviation of y series n= number of observations if there is no need to calculate standard deviation of x and y directly using the following formula \(r=\frac{\sigma x y}{\sqrt{\sigma x^{2} \times \sigma y^{2}}}\) here, x(x – \(\overline{x}\)), y = (y – \(\overline{y}\)) short-cut method this method is used when mean value is not in whole number but in fractions"
19616,"in this method, deviation is calculated by taking the assumed mean both the series"
19617,"coefficient of correlation is calculated using the following formula here, dx = deviation of x series from the assumed mean = (x – a) dy = deviation of y series from the assumed mean = (y – a) σ dxdy – sum of the multiple of dx and dy σ dx2 = sum of square of dx σ dy2 = sum of square of dy σdx= sum of deviation of x-series σdy = sum of deviation of y-series n = total number of items step deviation method coefficient of correlation is calculated using the following formula spearman’s rank correlation coefficient in 1904, ‘charles edwards spearman’ developed a formula to calculate coefficient correlation of qualitative variables"
19618,"coefficient of rank correlation when ranks are equal formula here, m = number of items of equal ranks"
19619,importance or significance of correlation the study of correlation shows the direction and degree of relationship between the variables
19620,correlation analysis facilitates business decisions because the trend path of one variable may suggest the expected changes in the other
19621,construction of simple index numbers there are two methods of constructing simple index numbers
19622,"(i) simple aggregative method in this method, we use the following formula \(p_{01}=\frac{\sigma p_{1}}{\sigma p_{0}} \times 100\) here, p01 = price index of current year σp1 = sum of prices of the commodities in the current year σp0 = sum of prices of the commodities in the base year (ii) simple average of price relatives method according to this method, we first find out price relatives from each commodity and then take simple average of all the prices relatives"
19623,"price relatives, p01 = \(\frac{\text { current year price }\left(p_{1}\right)}{\text { base year price }\left(p_{0}\right)} \times 100\) we can find out price index number of the current year by using the following formula \(p_{01}=\frac{\sum\left[\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}} \times 100\right]}{n}\) construction of weighted index numbers (i) weighted average of price relative method according to this method, weighted sum of the price relatives is divided by the sum total of the weight"
19624,"in this method, goods are given weight according to their quantity, thus \(p_{01}=\frac{\sigma r w}{\sigma w}\) here, p01 = index number for the current year in relation to the base year w = weight r = price relative (ii) weighted aggregative method under this method, different goods are accorded weight according to the quantity bought therefore, suggested different techniques of weighting some of well known methods are as under fisher’s method is considered as ‘ideal’ because it is based on variable weights"
19625,it takes into consideration the price and quantities of both the base year and current year
19626,it is based on geometric mean (gm) which is regarded as the best mean for calculating index number
19627,fisher’s index number satisfies both the time reversal test and factor reversal test
19628,consumer price index or cost of living index number the consumer price index is the index number which measures the averages change in prices paid by the specific class of consumers for goods and services consumed by them in the current year in comparison with base year
19629,"in india, the wholesale price index numbers are constructed on weekly basis"
19630,industrial production index the index number of industrial production measures changes in the level of industrial production comprising many industries
19631,it includes the production of the public and the private sector
19632,the formula for the index is \(p_{01}=\frac{\sigma q_{1} \times w}{\sigma w} \times 100\) construction of index number of industrial production classification of industries statistics or data related to industrial production weightage agricultural production index index number of agricultural production is weighted average of quantity relatives

19634,it is a short form of a bombay stock exchange sensitive index
19635,it is constructed with 1978-79 as the reference year or the base year
19636,it consists of 30 stocks of leading companies in the country
19637,purpose of constructing index number purpose of constructing index number of prices is to know the relative change or percentage in the price level over time
19638,"a rising general price level over time is a pointer towards inflation, while a falling general price level over time is a pointer towards deflation"
19639,purpose of constructing index number of quantity is to know relative change or percentage change in the quantum or volume of output of different goods and services
19640,a rising index of quantity suggests a rising level of economic activity and vice-versa

19725,it makes sense of the data so that it can be organized as knowledge
19726,"• mental process: (i) mental processes are activities of the mind and brain, related to cognition"
19727,"(ii) we use mental processes when we think or remember something, or solve a problem"
19728,"(iii) however, these mental activities are -different from neural activities, though they are mutually overlapping processes"
19729,(iv) the mind emerges and evolves as our interactions and experiences in this world get dynamically organized in the form of a system which is responsible for the occurrence of various mental processes
19730,"(v) mental processes include reasoning, learning, thinking, problem solving, perception, etc"
19731,• experiences: experiences can be defined as the learning acquired through everyday life situation

19734,(v) the nature of the experience can only be understood by analyzing a complex set of internal and external conditions
19735,(vi) experiences are important because most of our learning is based on experiences
19736,• behaviours: (i) behaviours are responses or reactions we make or activities we engage in
19737,"(ii) some behaviours such as thinking may be simple or complex, short or enduring"
19738,"(iii) on the other hand, some behaviours can be outwardly seen or sensed and are called overt, for example laughing"
19739,(iv) all behaviours can be explained on the basis of s-r (stimulus response relations)
19740,"any behaviour, overt or covert, is associated with or triggered by a stimulus"
19741,"(vi) the same stimulus can have different responses, due to the organism variable"
19742,it emphasises upon an individual’s uniqueness and variation that make him different from other
19743,"• psychology as a discipline (i) it studies behaviour, experience and mental processes"
19744,(ii) it seeks to understand and explain how the mind works and how different mental processes result in different behaviours
19745,"(iii) when we observe others, our own point of view or ways of understanding the world influence our interpretations of their behaviours and experiences"
19746,(iv) psychologists try to minimize such biases in their explanations of behaviour and experience in various ways
19747,(v) some do so by making their analysis scientific and objective
19748,(vi) others seek to explain behaviour from the point of view of those experiencing persons because they think that selectivity is a necessary aspect of human experience
19749,"there are fast developing brain imaging techniques like mri, ecg, etc"
19750,"which make it possible to study brain processes in real time, i.e, when they are actually taking place"
19751,– psychology as hybrid science : psychology is a hybrid science that draws its influence from both natural and social sciences
19752,"• as a natural science : (i) modem psychology has developed because of the application of the scientific method to study, psychological phenomenon"
19753,"(ii) as a physical science, it emphasizes on data that is systematic and can be studied under controlled conditions"

19757,(vi) a hypothesis is a tentative solution to a problem that helps in guiding a research or a theory
19758,(vii) hypothesis has been successfully used for determining many theories related to learning and memory
19759,"for example, the way a child has been brought up in his family will shape his personality"
19760,we are aware of all the outside environment as well as of the processes taking place in ourselves

19763,• psychology is a social science because it studies the behaviour of human beings in their social tests cultural context
19764,• psychology as a social science discipline focuses on humans as social beings
19765,"• it focuses on the individual and communities in relation to their social, cultural and physical environment"
19766,• if we go back in history psychology was defined as the science of the mind
19767,"the use of term mind was considered to be relevant since it represents all the mental phenomena such as perceiving, thinking, imagining, reasoning and so on"
19768,"but, certain difficulties regarding the term mind, its nature and its relationship with the body continued to persist"
19769,• due to many researches particularly in neurology the term ‘mind’ has returned in psychology
19770,it is true that mind and brain are different and mind cannot exist without brain
19771,recent studies in neuro science has proved that there is a relationship between mind and behaviour
19772,these researches and neurological experiments proved that a person suffer from damage of some part of the brain but his mind had remained intact
19773,• popular notions about the discipline of psychology should be understood
19774,psychology as a science explains patterns of beha viour which can be predicted and explains behaviour before the act occur common sense
19775,"they attain educational and professional qualification and understand, predict and modify human behaviour by scientific methods"
19776,"• the emergence of psychology as a science of mental processes, behaviour and experiences can be attributed to certain important development in physiology and physics as well as to the efforts of william wilhelm wundt who established first psychological laboratory in 1879"
19777,• the evolution of psychology can be traced in the major schools of psychological thoughts
19778,• structuralism: it was proposed by wundt and he studied the structure of conscious experiences by introspection
19779,• introspection is a procedure in which individual or subjects in psychological experiments are asked to describe their own mental processes or experiences scientifically in detail
19780,• functionalism: it was proposed by william james and jonh dewey
19781,they studied the functions of concious experiences in how people deal with the environment using introspection method
19782,it shows the adaptation of human behaviour according to their changing needs
19783,"• gestalt psychology: the school was proposed by koffka, kohler and werthiemer"
19784,"according to gestalt psychology, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
19785,"according to this, psychology must focus on what is observable and verifiable"
19786,• humanistic perspective: it was a revolt against psychoanalysis and behaviourism proposed by carl rogers and abraham maslow
19787,it stated that human strive to grow and unfold their inner potential
19788,it views human beings as actively constructing their mind through their exploration into the physical and social world
19789,piaget stated that children actively construct their own minds whereas vygofsky suggested that the mind is a joint cultural construction and emerges as a result of interaction between children and adults
19790,• the modem era of human psychology began in the department of philosophy at calcutta university where the first syllabus of experiment on psychology was introduced and the first psychology laboratory was established in 1915
19791,calcutta university started the first department of psychology in the year 1916 and another department of applied psychology in 1938
19792,• psychology as a science is closely related to other sciences

19798,"psychology provides understanding of voting behaviour, exercise of power, opinion polls etc"
19799,"sociology is positively related to psychology, e.g., psychology studies human behaviour whereas sociology studies human behaviour in society, i.e., socio cultural context"
19800,"• the information processing approach in cognitive psychology, to explain memory and concept of artificial intelligence is highly linked with computer sciences"
19801,"• psychological principles explain crime, criminal behaviour, how well a witness remembers a crime, etc"
19802,"similarly psychology has close bonds with mass communication, music and fine arts, architecture and engineering"
19803,• psychology as a discipline not only provide understanding to the development of theoretical knowledge of human behaviour but it has close linkages across psychological processes
19804,"psychologists now a days employed to help in diverse activities in different domains of professional activities including hospitals, educational settings, industrial organisations, training institutes, military and government organisations"
19805,• psychology continuously provides knowledge and understanding of human behaviour in different domains
19806,"some of the emerging perspectives are evolutionary psychology, cultural psychology and positive psychology"
19807,• evolutionary psychology is an approach in social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modem evolutionary perspective
19808,• it seeks to identify which human psychological traits are involved in adaptations—that is the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection
19809,• the goal of research in evolutionary psychology is to discover and understand the design of the human mind
19810,"• it is a theoretical approach to psychology that attempts to explain useful mental and psychological traits — such as memory, perception or language — as adaptations, i.e., as the functional products of natural selection"
19811,• the purpose of this approach is to bring the functional way of thinking about biological mechanism such as the immune system into the field of psychology
19812,• in short evolutionary psychology is focused on how evolution has shaped the mind and behaviour
19813,• cultural psychology is the study of how psychological and behavioural tendencies are rooted in and embodied in culture
19814,"• it studies how mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitute, i.e., people are shaped by culture and their culture is shaped by them"
19815,"• cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices, regulate, express and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for hurrian kind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self and emotion (richard shweder)"
19816,• contemporary psychologists have shown increasing interest in understanding what makes life good and meaningful
19817,"• there are some themes which provides direction to research and application of psychology are to develop principles of behaviour and mental processes, function of the attributes of persons and environment, causality of human behaviour, culturally constructed human behaviour and controlling and modifying the behaviour"
19818,• psychology can be viewed in two fold perspective which are complementary to each other i.e
19819,basic psychology provides theories through researchers whereas applied psychology is related to the category of application according to the needs of society
19820,• psychologists study a wide range of issues related to mental and behavioural functioning
19821,psychologists study how the biological system works and socio-cultural bases shapes human behaviour
19822,the basic psychological processes are parts of a dynamic regulated system

19869,thinking is an internal cognitive process which can be inferred from overt behaviour
19870,we can say that thinking is a silent speech because thinking is based on concepts and words
19871,"our thought process is based on mental images, i.e., mental representations that stand for objects or events that have a picture like quality"
19872,"concepts are ideas that represent a class or category of objects, events, or activities"
19873,concepts can be very general form such as ‘fruit’ called superordinate concept
19874,the concept ‘mango’ is more specific but can still be a basic level type
19875,concepts can be classified as natural concepts and artificial concepts also
19876,"cognition includes thinking, problem solving, concept formation, and the processing of information to obtain judgments and decisions"
19877,thinking is a problem-solving process in which we use ideas or symbols in place of overt activity
19878,it varies from the use of motor trial and error to thquse of mental images and previously programmed rules
19879,the information processing approach is a different way of understanding thinking and related processes
19880,this approach looks at the process of thinking in terms of active processing of information by the human brain
19881,"it involves various capacities as planning, decision making and solving the problem"
19882,the information processing perspective suggest that cognitive development can best be understood in terms of improvements in basic aspects of information processing
19883,thinking is involved in the system of inputs-central processing-outputs where these three aspects function as a whole
19884,"in reasoning the goal may not be clear; whereas in explicit problem solving, variations in behaviour result from changed external stimuli, in reasoning this may not be so simple"
19885,reasoning begins with a question for which we do not have a ready answer
19886,"it begins with a definition of the problem, asking first of all if it is a real problem"
19887,"next comes working on the problem, organizing it in relation to principles"
19888,"we go through the process of coming to a conclusion, determining the best possible one"

19890,the review is important in enabling us to learn from experience
19891,problem solving is thinking directed towards the solution of a specific problem
19892,"mental set, functional fixedness, lack of motivation and persistence are some of the obstacles in problem solving"
19893,reasoning refers to realistic thinking process that draws a conclusion from a set of facts
19894,when we start with assumption then it is called deductive reasoning but when our reasoning is based on facts and observation than it is called inductive reasoning

19903,language is a system of combining symbols (such as words) so that an unlimited number of meaningful statements can be made for the purpose of communicating with others
19904,major development in language occurs during the first two or three years of age
19905,most of psychologists believe that language development in children is a product of heredity and environment
19906,children universally seem to have a ‘critical period’ for learning language
19907,"cognitive development is about how a child’s way of knowing the world or thinking, changes over time"
19908,piaget and vygotsky were pioneers in this field and developed theories about the way cognitive development occurs
19909,"according to piaget, children’s thinking is qualitatively different from that of adults, passing through distinct stages of development"
19910,"he further stated that all children progress through these changes in exactly the same sequence, although the specific age at which a child makes a transition from one stage to another can vary"

19928,it performs the following functions: (i) enables continuity of the species
19929,"the mechanism to produce offsprings shows large variations, depending on organisms habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors"
19930,"based on the participation of one or two organisms, reproduction can be of following two types: (i) asexual reproduction (ii) sexual reproduction 3"
19931,"thus, the offsprings are genetically and morphologically identical to one another and to their parent"

19990,(ii) only the functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte or embryo sac
19991,"(iii) nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei, which move to the opposite poles forming the 2-nucleate embryo sac"
19992,(iv) nuclear divisions result into the formation of 4-nucleate and later 8-nucleate stages of the embryo sac
19993,(v) six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and organised into cells
19994,"the remaining two nuclei called polar nuclei, are situated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell"

20079,(vi) preventive measures for hiv infection are: (a) national aids control organisation (naco) set-up in 1991 and other ngos educate people about aids
20080,(b) role of who to prevent hiv infection: * ensure use of disposable syringes and needles
20081,cancer can be defined as an uncontrolled growth or proliferation of cells without any differentiation
20082,"(i) in our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated"
20083,(iii) cancer cells lost the property of contact inhibition (contact with other cells inhibit the uncontrolled growth)
20084,"(iv) the repeated division of cancerous cells, form a large mass of cells called tumours"
20085,(v) cancer cells move from tumour to new sites through blood for forming secondary tumours
20086,this invasion of cancer cells from one part to other parts by the body fluids is called metastasis
20087,(vi) types of tumour and differences between them: vii) cancer causing viruses are called oncogenic viruses
20088,"(viii) normal cells have genes called cellular oncogenes (c-onc.) or proto oncogenes, which are present in inactive state, but under certain conditions (like mutation) could lead to oncogenic transformation of the cells"
20089,"they may be (a) chemicals as in cigarette smoke, benzopyrene, dyes, paints, etc"
20090,"(c) physical ionising radiation like x-rays and y-rays, non-ionising radiations like uv-rays"
20091,(x) cancer can be detected by the following methods: (a) blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts
20092,"(c) radiography by x-rays, to detect cancer of the internal organs"
20093,"(d) computed tomography (ct) using x-rays, to generate a 3-d image of internal tissue"
20094,(e) resonance imaging involves use of non-ionising radiation and strong magnetic field to detect pathological and physiological changes in living tissue
20095,(f) monoclonal antibodies against cancer-specific antigens are also used for cancer detection
20096,(xi) treatment of cancer involves following methods: (a) surgery tumours are removed by surgery to check further spread of cancer cells
20097,"(b) radiation therapy tumour cells are irradiated by lethal doses of radiation, taking care to protect the surrounding normal cells"
20098,(c) chemotherapy several chemotherapeutic drugs are used to kill cancer cells
20099,most cancers are treated by the combination of the above three
20100,(d) immunotherapy biological modifiers like a-interferons are used to activate the immune system and helps in destroying the tumour
20101,"discoveries related to structure of dna (i) friedrich meischer in 1869, first identified dna as an acidic substance present in the nucleus and named it as ‘nuclein’"
20102,"(ii) james watson and francis crick, proposed a very simple double helix model for the structure of dna in 1953 based on x-ray diffraction data"
20103,"(iii) erwin chargaff proposed that for a double-stranded dna, the ratios between adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine are constant and equals to one"
20104,salient features of double-helix structure of dna (i) dna is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides
20105,"it is made up of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate and the bases project inside"
20106,(iii) the bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (h—bonds) forming base pairs (bp)
20107,adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa
20108,the pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm and there are roughly 10 bp in each turn
20109,"due to this, the distance between a base pair in a helix is about 0.34 nm"
20110,(v) the plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix
20111,this confers stability to the helical structure in addition to h—bonds
20112,"the length of a dna double helix is about 2.2 meters (6.6 x 109 bp x 0.34 x 10-9 m/bp) therefore, it needs special packaging in a cell"
20113,"(i) in prokaryotic cells (which do not have a defined nucleus), such as e.coli, dna (being negatively charged) is held with some proteins (that have positive charges) in a region called as nucleoid"
20114,the dna in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by proteins
20115,"(ii) in eukaryotes, there is a set of positively charged proteins called histones that are rich in basic amino acid residues, lysines and arginines (both positive)"
20116,histones are organised to form a unit of eight molecules called histone octamer
20117,the negatively charged dna is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome
20118,nucleosomes constitute the repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin (thread-like stained structure)
20119,"under electron microscope, the nucleosomes in chromatin can be seen as beads-on-string"
20120,this structure in chromatin is packaged to form chromatin fibres that further coils and condense to form chromosomes at metaphase stage
20121,(iv) the packaging of chromatin at higher level requires additional set of proteins which are collectively called non-histone chromosomal (nhc) proteins
20122,"(v) in a nucleus, some regions of chromatin are loosely packed (stains light) called euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin)"
20123,"in some regions, chromatin is densely packed (stains dark) called heterochromatin (inactive chromatin)"
20124,transfonning principle (i) frederick griffith (1928) carried out a series of experiments with streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium causing pneumonia)
20125,"(ii) according to him, when the bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (s), while others produce rough (r) colonies"
20126,"(iii) this is because the s-strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while r-strain does not"
20127,(iv) mice infected with s-strain (virulent) die from pneumonia but mice infected with r-strain do not develop pneumonia
20128,(v) griffith killed bacteria by heating and observed that heat-killed s-strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them
20129,"on injecting mixture of heat-killed s and live r bacteria, the mice died"
20130,"(vi) from this experiment, he concluded that the ‘r-strain bacteria’ had been transformed by the heat-killed s-strain bacteria"
20131,"some transforming principle transferred from heat-killed s-strain, had enabled the r-strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent"
20132,"biochemical nature of transforming principle (i) oswald avery, colin macleod and maclyn mccarty, worked to determine the biochemical nature of transforming principle in griffith’s experiment"
20133,"(ii) they purified biochemicals (proteins, rna and dna, etc) from heat-killed s-cells and discovered that dna alone from s-bacteria caused r-bacteria to be transformed"
20134,(iii) they also discovered that protease (protein digesting enzyme) and rnaases (rna-digesting enzymes) did not affect transformation
20135,"(iv) digestion with dnase did inhibit transformation, indicating that dna caused transformation"
20136,dna is the genetic material (i) alfred hershey and martha chase (1952) gave unequivocal proof that dna is the genetic material
20137,"(ii) in their experiments, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) were used"
20138,(iii) they grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on sulphur containing radioactive medium
20139,(iv) viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive dna but not radioactive protein because dna contains phosphorus but protein does not
20140,"in the same way, viruses grown on radioactive sulphur contained radioactive protein, but not radioactive dna because dna does not contain sulphur"
20141,"as the infection proceeded, viral coats were removed from the bacteria by agitating them in a blender"
20142,the virus particles were separated from the bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge
20143,"(vi) bacteria which were infected with viruses that had radioactive dna were radioactive, indicating that dna was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria"
20144,(vii) bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive
20145,this indicated that the proteins did not enter the bacteria from viruses
20146,it proved that dna is a genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria
20147,properties of genetic material (i) it became establised that dna is the genetic material from the hershey-chase experiment
20148,"(ii) in some viruses, rna was also reported as genetic material, e.g"
20149,(iii) characteristics of a genetic material (a) it should be able to replicate
20150,(c) it should provide scope for slow changes (mutation) that are required for evolution
20151,(d) it should be able to express itself in the form of ‘mendelian characters’
20152,"(iv) according to the above mentioned rules, both the nucleic acids (dna and rna) have the ability to direct duplications"
20153,stability can be explained in dna as the two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together in appropriate conditions
20154,"(v) the 2′ — oh group present at every nucleotide in rna is a reactive group and makes rna labile and easily degradable, hence it is reactive"
20155,(vi) dna is chemically less reactive and structurally more stable when compared to rna
20156,"so, among the two nucleic acids, the dna is a predominant genetic material"
20157,viruses having rna genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster
20158,"(viii) dna is dependent on rna for protein synthesis, while rna can directly code for it"
20159,"this concluded that the dna being more stable is suitable for storage of genetic information, while for the transmission of genetic information, rna is suitable"
20160,"francis crick proposed the central dogma in molecular biology, which states that the genetic information flows from 15"
20161,replication scheme for replication of dna termed as semiconservative dna replication was proposed by watson and crick (1953)
20162,"according to it, (i) the two strands would separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new complementary strands"
20163,"(ii) after replication, each dna molecule would have one parental and one newly synthesised strand"
20164,"coli and later from higher organisms, such as plants and human cells"
20165,matthew meselson and franklin stahl performed the following experiments to prove this in 1958
20166,coli was grown in a medium containing 15nh4c1 as the only nitrogen source for many generations
20167,15n got incorporated into newly synthesised dna (and other nitrogen containing compounds)
20168,this heavy dna molecule could be distinguished from the normal dna by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (cscl) density gradient
20169,(ii) they then transferred the cells into a medium with normal 14nh4cl and took samples at various definite intervals as the cells multiplied and extracted the dna that remained as double stranded helices
20170,dna samples were separated independently on cscl gradients to measure dna densities
20171,"(iii) the dna that was extracted from the culture, one generation (after 20 min) after the transfer from 15 n to 14n medium had a hybrid or intermediate density"
20172,dna extracted from the culture after another generation (after 40 min) was composed of equal amounts of this hybrid dna and of light dna
20173,"(iv) very similar experiments were carried out by taylor and colleagues on vicia faba (faba beans) using radioactive thymidine and the same results, i.e"
20174,dna replication machinery and enzymes process of replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes)
20175,"(i) the main enzyme is dna-dependent dna polymerase, since it uses a dna template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides"
20176,the average rate of polymerisation by these enzymes is approximately 2000 bp/second
20177,(ii) these polymerases has to catalyse the reaction with high degree of accuracy because any mistake during replication would result into mutations
20178,"dna polymerisation is an energy demanding process, so deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes, i.e"
20179,(iv) many additional enzymes are also required in addition to dna-dependent dna polymerase
20180,"(v) (a) replication in dna strand occurs within a small opening of the dna helix, known as replication fork"
20181,"(b) dna-dependent dna polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, i.e"
20182,"consequently, on one strand (template 3′-5′), the replication is continuous, while on the other strand (template 5′-3′), it is discontinuous"
20183,the discontinuously synthesised fragments called okazaki fragments are later joined by dna ligase
20184,origin of replication (i) dna polymerases cannot initiate the process of replication on their own
20185,"also, replication does not initiate randomly at any place in dna"
20186,"so, there is a definite region in e.coli dna where the replication originates"
20187,"(ii) due to this requirement, a piece of dna, if needed to be propagated during recombinant dna procedures, requires a vector"
20188,"there are evidences to prove that essential life processes, such as metabolism, translation, splicing, etc., have evolved around rna"
20189,(i) there are some important biochemical reactions in living systems that are catalysed by rna catalysts and not by protein enzyne
20190,"(ii) dna has evolved from rna with chemical modifications that make it more stable because rna being a catalyst was reactive and hence, unstable"
20191,there are following three types of rnas: (i) mrna (messenger rna) provides the template for transcription
20192,(ii) trna (transfer rna) brings amino acids and reads the genetic code
20193,(iii) rrna (ribosomal rna) plays structural and catalytic role during translation
20194,all the three rnas are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell
20195,traription is the process of copying genetic information from one strand of the i dnjs
20196,"the principle of complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine now forms base pair with uracil instead of l thymine"
20197,"(i) in transcription, only a segment of dna is duplicated and on iv one of the strands is"
20198,"both the strands are not copied because • if both the strands code for rna, two different rna me’ ^cules and two different proteins would be formed, hence complicating the genetic information transfer machinery"
20199,"• since two rna produced would be complementary to each other, they would form a double-stranded rna without translation, making the process of transcription futile"
20200,(ii) a transcription unit in dna is defined by three regions in the dna which are as follows: (a) a promoter (b) the structural gene (c) a terminator (iii) the two strands of dna have opposite polarity and the dna-dependent rna polymerase also catalyse the polymerisation in only one direction that is 5′ -» 3′
20201,(iv) the strand that has the polarity 3′-» 5′ acts as a template and is referred to as template strand
20202,the other strand which has the polarity (5′ -> 3′) and the sequence same as rna (t at the place of u) is displaced during transcription
20203,(v) the promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a transcription unit
20204,(vi) the promoter is located towards 5′ end (upstream) of the structural gene
20205,(vii) it is the dna sequence that provides binding site for rna polymerase and the presence of promoter defines the template and coding strands
20206,"by switching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template strands could be reversed"
20207,(viii) the terminator is located towards 3f-end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the process of transcription
20208,(ix) there are additional regulatory sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the promoter
20209,transcription unit and the gene (i) a gene can be defined as the functional unit of inheritance
20210,(ii) a cistron is a segment of dna coding for a polypeptide
20211,(iii) the structural gene in a transcription unit could be said as monodstronic (mostly in eukaryotes) or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes)
20212,(iv) the coding sequences or expressed sequences are defined as exons
20213,(v) introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or processed rna
20214,"(vi) sometimes, the regulatory sequences are loosely defined as regulate 5: even though these sequences do not code for any rna or protein"
20215,transcription in prokaryotes occur in the following steps: (i) a single dna-dependent rna polymerase catalyses the transcription of all types of rna in bacteria
20216,(iii) it uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity
20217,"(v) once the polymerase reaches the terminator region, the nascent rna falls off, so also the rna polymerase"
20218,(vi) rna polymerase is only capable of catalysing the process of elongation
20219,"it associates transiently with initiation-factor (a) and terminator factor (b), to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively"
20220,"(vii) since, the mrna does not require any processing to become active and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment, many times the translation can begin much before the mrna is fully transcribed"
20221,"as a result, transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria"
20222,(i) there are at least three rna polymerases in the nucleus other than the rna polymerase in organelles
20223,"rna polymerase iii is responsible for transcription of frna, 5srrna and snrnas (small nuclear rnas)"
20224,"rna polymerase ii transcribes precursor of mrna, the heterogenous nuclear rna (/mrna)"
20225,"(ii) another complexity is that, the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional"
20226,"in this process, introns are removed and exons are joined in a definite order"
20227,"in capping, an unusual nucleotide is added to the 5′-end of /mrna"
20228,"in tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3′-end in a template"
20229,"it is the fully processed /mrna, now called mrna, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation process"
20230,significance of these complexities are: (i) the split gene arrangements represent an ancient feature of genome
20231,(iii) the process of splicing represents the dominance of rna world
20232,(a) inbreeding refers to the mating between closely related individuals within the same breed for 4-6 generations
20233,the strategies for inbreeding are as follow: • identifying superior males and females of the same breed
20234,• evaluation of progeny obtained from the above mating to identify superior males and females among them
20235,"• a superior female, in case of cattle, is the cow or buffalo that produces more milk per lactation"
20236,"a superior male is bull, which gives rise to superior progeny as compared to other males"
20237,effects of inbreeding are: • it is used to evolve a pureline (inbreeding increases homozygosity)
20238,"• harmful recessive genes are exposed by inbreeding, which are then eliminated by the selection"
20239,"• superior genes can be accumulated by inbreeding, the undesirable genes"
20240,• productivity of inbreed population is increased by selection at every step
20241,"• in this case, selected animals of the breeding population are mated with unrelated superior animals of the same breed"
20242,"(b) outbreeding is the breeding of unrelated animals, either of the same breed but not having common ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-crossing) or of different breeds (cross-breeding) or even different species (interspecific hybridisation)"
20243,"it can be of the following types: • out-crossing is the practice of mating of animals, within the same breed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4-6 generations"
20244,"– it is done to increase milk production, growth rate in cattle’s beef, etc"
20245,• cross-breeding refers to the mating of superior males of one breed with superior females of another breed
20246,– it helps in accumulate desirable qualities of two breeds into progeny
20247,"– a new sheep breed, hisardale is developed in punjab by crossing bikaneri ewes and marino rams"
20248,• interspecific hybridisation refers to crossing between male and female animals of two different related species
20249,"– example of interspecific hybridisation, is a mule obtained by crossing a male donkey with a female horse"
20250,the semen from selected male parent is injected into the reproductive tract of selective female parent
20251,its advantages are as follow: – helps to overcome problems related to normal mating
20252,– semen can be stored and frozen for the later use
20253,multiple ovulation embryo transfer (moet) technology is a programme for herd improvement
20254,"(i) the method includes following steps: (a) a cow is administered with hormones fsh-like activity, to induce follicular maturation and superovulation"
20255,"(b) the cow produces 6-8 eggs instead of one egg, normally released per cycle"
20256,(c) a cow is now mated with an elite bull or artificially inseminated
20257,(d) the fertilised eggs at 8-32 celled stages are recovered non-surgically and transferred to surrogate mothers
20258,"(ii) this technology is used for cattle, sheep, rabbits, buffaloes, mares, etc"
20259,(iii) high milk-yielding breeds of females and high quality (lean meat with less lipid) meat-yielding bulls have been bred successfully to increase the herd size in a short time
20260,sterilisation or surgical methods are used by male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more pregnancies
20261,"in this method, a small portion of vas deferens is removed or tied up through an incision on the scrotum"
20262,"(b) tubectomy is applied in females, where a small part of fallopian tubes is removed or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen or through vagina"
20263,(7) medical termination of pregnancy (mtp) or induced abortion is intentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term
20264,(a) the government of india had legalised mtp in 1971 with some strict conditions to avoid its misuse
20265,these are important to check indiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high in india
20266,"(b) mtps are done in certain cases where pregnancy can be harmful and even fatal either to the mother or the foetus or both, or duets failure of contraceptive used during coitus or rapes"
20267,(c) mtps are considered relatively safe during the first trimester (upto 12 weeks) of pregnancy
20268,"(d) during second trimester, mtps are unsafe and could be fatal too"
20269,(e) about 45-50 million mtps are carried out in a year all over the world
20270,it has significant role in decreasing population though it is not meant for that purpose
20271,origin of first cell (i) first non-cellular life forms originated three million years ago
20272,(iii) cellular life form first evolved about 2000 million years ago
20273,the first form of life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules it is accepted by many scientists
20274,evidences of evolution come from (i) palaeontology (ii) comparative anatomy and morphology (iii) biochemical/physiology (iv) biogeography (v) embryology (i) palaeontology is the study of fossils
20275,the fossils are the remains of past organisms preserved in sedimentary rocks (a) rocks form sediments and a cross-section of earth’s crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other during the long history of earth
20276,"(b) different aged rock sediments contain fossils of different life forms, who died during the formation of the particular sediment, (c) some organisms appear similar to modern organisms"
20277,(d) a study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological period in which they existed
20278,"(e) the study showed that life forms varied over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-scale hence, new forms of life have evolved at different times in the history of earth, (ii) comparative anatomy and morphological evidences show the similarities and differences among the organisms of today and those that existed years ago"
20279,the evidences come from comparative study of external and internal structure
20280,(a) the organs with same structural design and origin but different functions are called homologous organs
20281,"examples are forelimbs of some animals like whales, bats and cheetah have similar anatomical structure, such as humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges"
20282,"in plants also, thorns and tendrils of bougainvillea and cucurbita represent homology"
20283,the same structure developed along different directions due to adaptations to different needs
20284,(a) organs which are anatomically different but functionally similar are called analogous organs
20285,"it is the evolution in which different structures evolve for same function and hence, have similarity"
20286,(d) other examples of analogy are eyes of octopus and mammals; flippers of penguins and dolphins
20287,"these are degenerate, non-functional and rudimentary organs to the possessor, while correspond to fully developed and functional organs of related organisms"
20288,(a) there are about 90 vestigial organs in the human body
20289,"same of them are tail bone (coccyx), wisdom teeth, nictitating membrane, vermiform appendix, etc"
20290,(b) some examples from other animals are hip girdles and bones of the hind limbs in some whales and certain snakes and wings of flightless birds
20291,biochemical evidences (a) the metabolic processes in organisms are similar with same new materials and end products
20292,"for example, energy released by oxidation is stored in atp which then powers the energy requiring process"
20293,(b) molecular homology is the similarity among animals at the molecular level
20294,"for example, human dna differs in only 1.8% of its base pairs from chimpanzee dna and there is no difference between the two in the amino acid sequence for the protein cytochrome-c"
20295,(iv) biogeographical evidences the species restricted to a region develop unique features
20296,"also, species present in far separated regions show similarity of ancestry"
20297,this can be explained with the help of following processes: i
20298,adaptive radiation is an evolutionary process in which an ancestral stock gives rise to new species adapted to new habitats and new ways of life
20299,"examples are (0 darwin’s finches these were small black birds, which darwin observed in galapagos island"
20300,(a) he observed many varieties of finches in the same island
20301,(b) all varieties of finches had evolved from original seed-eating finches
20302,(c) there was alternation in beaks enabling some to become insectivorous and some vegetarian
20303,"(ii) marsupials of australia a number of marsupials, different from each other evolved from an ancestral stock, all within the australian island continent"
20304,parallel evolution refers to independent development of similar characters in two animal groups of common ancestry living in similar habitats of different continents
20305,examples are marsupial mammals in australia show parallel evolution as they have evolved from placental mammals
20306,all these closely resemble and look similar to a corresponding marsupial
20307,iii. convergent evolution is development of similar adaptive functional structures in unrelated groups of organisms
20308,(ii) spiny anteater and scaly anteater belong to different orders of class-mammalia
20309,(v) embryological evidences study of comparative embryology shows common patterns of development
20310,(a) the principles of embryonic development were given by von baer
20311,"(b) ernst haeckel propounded the theory of recapitulation or biogenetic law which states that an individual organism in its development (ontogeny) tends to repeat the stages passed through by its ancestors (phylogeny), i.e"
20312,(c) this means that the life history of an animal reflects its evolutionary history
20313,"for example, during the life history, frog’s tadpole larva resembles fishes, the ancestors of amphibia"
20314,the presence of gill clefts in all vertebrate embryos including human provides a strong evidence in support of organic evolution
20315,"(vi) anthropogenic evidences excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc has resulted in selection of resistant varieties in a lesser time scale"
20316,this is also true for microbes against which antibiotics or drugs have been used
20317,all these evidences tell us that ‘elvolution is a stochastic process based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms’
20318,mendel’s experimental procedure (i) he observed one trait or character at a time
20319,"for example, he crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of one gene"
20320,(ii) mendel hybridised plants with alternate forms of a single trait (monohybrid cross)
20321,the seeds produced by these crosses were grown to develop into plants of filial1 progeny or f1-generation
20322,(iii) he then self-pollinated the tall f1 plants to produce plants of filial2 progeny or f2-generation
20323,"(iv) in later experiments, mendel also crossed pea plants with two contrasting characters known as dihybrid cross"
20324,"mendel’s observation in his experiment (i) in frgeneration, mendel found that all pea plants were tall and none were dwarf"
20325,(ii) he also observed other pair of traits and found that f1 always resembled either one of its parents and the traits of the other parent was not found in them
20326,"(iii) in f2-generation, he found that some of the off springs were dwarf, i.e"
20327,the character which were not seen in f1-generation were expressed in f2-generation
20328,(iv) these contrasting traits (tall/dwarf) did not show any mixing either in f1 or in f2-generation
20329,(v) similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied
20330,"only one of the parental traits was expressed in f1-generation, while at f2-generation stage, both the traits were expressed in the ratio of 3:1"
20331,(vi) mendel also found identical results in dihybrid cross as in monohybrid cross
20332,"(vii) on self-pollinating f2 plants, he found that dwarf f2 plants continued to generate dwarf plants in f3 and f4-generations"
20333,"inferences of mendel’s experiments (i) mendel inferred that something was being passed down, from parents to offspring through the gamete over successive generations"
20334,"(iii) genes which codes for a pair of contrasting traits are called alleles or allelomorphs, i.e"
20335,"(iv) mendel also proposed that in a true breeding variety, the allelic pair of genes are identical or homozygous, tt and tt for tall or dwarf pea variety respectively"
20336,"(vii) when the tall (tt) and dwarf (tt) pea plant produce gametes, the alleles of the parental pair segregate from each other and only one allele is transmittted to a gamete"
20337,(viii) the gametes of the tall tt plants have the allele t and the dwarf tt plants have the allele t
20338,"(ix) this segregation of alleles is a random process and, so there is a 50% chance of a gamete containing either allele, as verified by the results of crossings"
20339,"after fertilisation of tt and tt traits, hybrids contain tt and are called heterozygous"
20340,"(x) mendel found the phenotype of tt to be similar as tt parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factor, one dominates the other (t in this case) and hence, is called the dominant factor, while the other factor (t) is recessive"
20341,(xi) allele can be similar in case of homozygous tt or tt and dissimilar in case of heterozygous tt
20342,"(xii) in tt plant, one character (height) is controlled by a gene hence, it is monohybrid and cross between tt and tt is called monohybrid cross"
20343,"mendel’s law of inheritance are based on his observations on monohybrid and dihybrid crosses, he proposed three laws: (i) law of dominance (first law) states that characters are controlled by genes which occur in pair, when two alternate forms of a trait or character (genes or alleles) are present in an organism, only one factor (dominant) expresses itself in f1-generation"
20344,it explains expression of genes in a cross and 3:1 ratio obtained in the f2-generation
20345,"(ii) law of segregation (second law) states that the factors or alleles of a pair segregate from each other during gamete formation, in a way that a gamete receives only one of the two factors"
20346,"(iii) law of independent assortment (third law) it is based on inheritance of two genes, i.e"
20347,"dihybrid cross which states that when two pairs of contrasting traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters"
20348,these factors randomly rearrange in the offsprings producing both parental and new combination of characters
20349,the punnett square can be used to understand the independent during meiosis
20350,incomplete dominance is a phenomenon in which the f: – hybrid shows characters intermediate of the parental genes
20351,"in this process, the phenotypic ratio of f2-generation deviates from the mendel’s monohybrid ratio"
20352,"example, inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower (snapdragon or antirrhinum sp) and four o’ clock plant (mirabilis jalapa)"
20353,"in a cross between red flower (rr) and white flower plant (rr), the f1 (rr) was pink (in figure)"
20354,"when f1 was self-pollinated, the f2 resulted in the ratio 1: 2: l 12"
20355,codominance is a phenomenon in which two alleles are able to express themselves independently when present together
20356,(i) a common example of codominance is abo blood groups in humans
20357,"(ii) the gene for blood group exist in three allelic forms ia , ib  and i"
20358,"(iii) ia and ib produce rbc surface antigens a and b, respectively, whereas ‘i’ does not produce any antigen"
20359,"(iv) ia and ib  both are dominant alleles, whereas t is the recessive allele"
20360,"(v) in case ia and ib  are present together, both express equally and produce both the surface antigens a and b"
20361,multiple allelism it can also be explained by abo blood grouping
20362,"multiple alleles can be found only when population studies are made since, an individual can have only two alleles"
20363,test cross it is a method devised by mendel to determine the genotype of an organism
20364,a cross is made of unknown dominant genotype with the recessive parent
20365,"(i) for example, fj hybrid (tt) heterozygous of a pure tall plant (tt) and a pure dwarf plant (tt) is crossed with a pure dwarf plant"
20366,"in this example, the progeny consists of tall and dwarf plants in the ratio  1:1"
20367,"(tall) (iii) in case of dihybrid test cross, where two traits are taken, a heterozygous individual is crossed with a homozygous recessive parent"
20368,pleiotropy it is the phenomenon in which a single gene exhibits multiple phenotypic expressions
20369,"for example, (i) phenylketonuria, a disorder caused by mutation in the gene coding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase"
20370,the affected individuals show hair and skin pigmentation and mental problems
20371,(ii) starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene with two alleles (b and b)
20372,"(a) starch is synthesised effectively by the homozygotes, bb and hence, the starch grains are large and the seeds at maturity are round"
20373,"(b) the homozygotes, bb are less efficient in starch synthesis, hence they have small starch grains and the seeds are wrinkled"
20374,"(c) the heterozygotes, bb produce round seeds, indicating that b is the dominant allele, but the starch grains are intermediate in size and hence, for the starch grain size, the alleles show incomplete dominance"
20375,"(d) it is an example of pleiotropy as the same gene controls two traits, i.e"
20376,"(e) here, it is to be mentioned that dominance is not an autonomous feature of the gene or its product, but it depends on the production of a particular phenotype from the gene product"
20377,"in this, traits are controlled by three or more genes (multiple genes)"
20378,the phenotype shows participation of each allele and is also influenced by the environment and is called quantitative inheritance as the character/phenotype can be quantified
20379,"for example, human skin colour which is caused by a pigment melanin"
20380,"the quantity of melanin is due to three pairs of polygenes (a, b and c)"
20381,"if it is black or very dark (aa bb cc) and white or very light (aa bb cc) individuals marry each other, the offspring shows intermediate colour often called mulatto (aa bb cc)"
20382,a total of eight allele combinations is possible in the gametes forming 27 distinct genotypes
20383,complementary genes complement the effect of each other to produce a phenotype
20384,"for example, in case of sweet pea, the flower colour is due to complementary genes"
20385,"rediscovery of mendel’s laws (i) though, mendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865, it remained unrecognised for several reasons till 1900"
20386,"some of them are as follow: (a) communication was difficult, so his work could not be widely publicised"
20387,(b) his concept of genes as stable unit that controlled the expression of traits and of the pair of alleles which did not blend was not accepted
20388,(c) his approach of using mathematics to explain biological phenomenon was new and unacceptable
20389,(d) he could not provide any physical proof for the existence of factors
20390,"(ii) in 1900, de vries, correns and von tschermak rediscovered mendel’s results independently"
20391,(iii) this led to discovery of chromosomes (structure in the nucleus that appeared to double and divide just before each cell division)
20392,chromosomal theory of inheritance was proposed independently by walter sutton and theodore boveri in 1902
20393,they united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with mendelian principles and called it chromosomal theory of inheritance
20394,the main points are as follow: (i) gametes (sperm and egg) transmit hereditary characters from one generation to another
20395,(iv) the two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous sites on the homologous chromosomes
20396,(u) the sperm and egg having haploid sets of chromosomes fuse to regain the diploid state
20397,(vi) homologous chromosomes synapse during meiosis and get separated to pass into different cells and is the basis of segregation and independent assortment during meiosis
20398,experimental verification of the chromosomal theory of inheritance was done by thomas hunt morgan and his colleagues
20399,"(i) morgan selected fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster for his experiments because: (a) they could be grown on simple artificial medium in the laboratory"
20400,(c) a single mating could produce a large number of flies
20401,(e) it has many types of hereditary variation that can be easily seen through low power microscopes
20402,(ii) linkage and recombination (a) the physical association of two genes on a chromosome is called linkage
20403,"(c) to explain the phenomena of linkage and recombination, morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked, i.e"
20404,he observed that two genes did not segregate independently of each other
20405,"(d) he observed that the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type, when two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome"
20406,"(e) morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (very low recombination), while others were loosely linked (higher recombination)"
20407,(f) recombination of linked genes is by crossing over (exchange of corresponding parts between the chromatids of homologous chromosomes)
20408,(g) alfred sturtevant (morgan’s student) used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome
20409,genetic maps are now used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole genomes as done in case of human genome sequencing project
20410,urinary bladder receives a duct from the seminal vesicle to form ejaculatory duct that runs through the prostate and opens into urethra
20411,(e) urethra receives the ducts of prostate gland and the bulbourethral gland (cowper’s glands) a little ahead and runs through the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus
20412,"(iii) the accessory glands of male reproductive system include (a) a pair of seminal vesicles, a prostate gland and a pair of bulbourethral glands (cowper’s glands)"
20413,(b) the secretion of all these glands is called seminal plasma
20414,"it is to provide nutrition to the spermatozoa, while travelling through female reproductive tract"
20415,(e) secretion of bulbourethral glands also helps in the lubrication of the penis
20416,it is made up of special erectile tissue that helps in erection of the penis
20417,it is covered by a loose fold of skin called foreskin or prepuce
20418,"female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, secondary sex organs, external genitalia and mammary glands"
20419,(i) ovaries are primary female sex organs which produce female gametes called ova and secrete the female sex hormones
20420,(a) these are located one on each side of the lower abdomen
20421,"(b) it is almond-shaped, 2-4 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width"
20422,(c) it is connected to the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments
20423,(d) each ovary is covered by a thin epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma
20424,"(ii) the female accessory ducts constitute oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina"
20425,(iii) each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus
20426,(a) the part of oviduct closer to the ovary is funnel-shaped infundibulum
20427,"(b) the edges of infundibulum possess finger-like projections called fimbriae, which help in collection of the ovum after ovulation"
20428,(c) infundibulum leads to a wider part of the oviduct called ampulla
20429,"(d) isthmus is the last part of the oviduct, which has a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus"
20430,it is attached to the pelvic wall and supported by ligaments
20431,"(b) perimetrium is the outermost thin membranous layer, myometrium is the middle thick layer of smooth muscles and endometrium is the innermost glandular layer which lines the uterine cavity"
20432,"(c) uterus opens into the vagina through a narrow cervix, its cavity is called cervical canal, which along with vagina forms birth canal"
20433,(e) smooth muscles in myometrium contract during parturition to deliver the baby
20434,(v) vagina is a muscular tube-like structure that opens to the outside
20435,"(vi) female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris and hymen"
20436,(a) mons pubis is a cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair
20437,(b) labia majora are fleshy folds of tissue which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening
20438,(c) labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora
20439,(d) hymen is a membrane that covers the opening of vagina partially
20440,it gets ruptured during vigorous physical activities or during the first coitus
20441,"(e) clitoris is a tiny finger-like structure, which lies at the upper junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening"
20442,(vii) mammary glands (breasts) are paired structures that contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat
20443,(a) glandular tissue of each mammary gland is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing the cluster of cells called alveoli
20444,"(b) the cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored in the cavities (lumen) of alveoli"
20445,the tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct
20446,"(d) several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla, which is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out"
20447,"(a) restriction enzymes cut the strand of dna a little away from the centre of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite strands"
20448,(c) there are overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strands as given in above figure
20449,"these are named so, because they form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counterparts"
20450,(d) the stickiness of the ends facilitates the action of the enzyme dna ligase
20451,"(e) restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form recombinant molecules of dna, which are composed of dna from different sources/genomes"
20452,"(f) these sticky ends are complementary to each other when cut by same restriction enzyme, therefore can be joined together (end-to-end) using dna ligases"
20453,separation and isolation of dna fragments (i) the cutting of dna by restriction’endonucleases results in the fragments of dna
20454,"(ii) the technique, which separates dna fragments based on their size is called gel electrophoresis"
20455,they can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through a medium/matrix
20456,"(iv) the most common medium used is agarose, a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds"
20457,(v) the dna fragments separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel
20458,(vi) the separated dna fragments can be visualised only after staining the dna with a compound known as ethidium bromide followed by exposure to uv radiation
20459,(vii) the dna fragments can be seen as bright orange coloured bands
20460,these separated bands are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece
20461,(viii) the purified dna fragments can be used in constructing recombinant dna by joining them with cloning vectors
20462,cloning vectors are the dna molecules that can carry a foreign dna segment into the host cell
20463,(i) the vectors used in recombinant dna technology can be: (a) plasmids autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal dna
20464,(c) cosmids hybrid vectors derived from plasmids which contain cos site of x phage
20465,(ii) copy number can be defined as the number of copies of vectors present in a cell
20466,"(iii) bacteriophages have high number per cell, so their copy number is also high in genome"
20467,(v) copy number can vary from 1-100 or more than 100 copies per cell
20468,"(vi) if an alien piece of dna is linked with bacteriophage or plasmid dna, its number can be multiplied equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage"
20469,(vii) features required to facilitate cloning into vector (a) origin of replication (ori)     (b) selectable marker (c) cloning sites                             (d) vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals
20470,(a) origin of replication (ori) is a sequence from where replication starts
20471,• any piece of dna when linked to this sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells
20472,the sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked dna
20473,(ii) selectable marker helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the transformants
20474,• transformation is a process through which a piece of dna is introduced in a host bacterium
20475,"• the genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin, etc, are some useful selectable markers for e"
20476,• ligation of alien dna is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the twoantibiotic resistance genes
20477,example is ligating a foreign dna at the bam hi site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pbr322
20478,-» the recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign dna
20479,"but, it still can be selected out from non-recombinant ones by plating the transformants on ampicillin containing medium"
20480,-» the transformants growing on ampicillin containing medium are then transferred on a medium containing tetracycline
20481,-» the recombinants will grow in ampicillin containing medium but not on that containing tetracycline
20482,the non-recombinants will grow on the medium containing both the antibiotics
20483,"in this example, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting the transformants whereas, the other antibiotic resistance gene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien dna and helps in selection of recombinants"
20484,"* selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure, so alternative selectable markers are developed which differentiate recombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability to produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate"
20485,"-» in this method, a recombinant dna is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme j3-galactosidase"
20486,"-» this results into inactivation of the enzyme, p-galactosidase (insertional inactivation)"
20487,"-> the bacterial colonies whose plasmids do not have an insert, produce blue colour, but others do not produce any colour, when grown on a chromogenic substrate"
20488,(c) cloning sites are required to link the alien dna with the vector
20489,• the vector requires very few or single recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes
20490,• the presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments leading to complication in gene cloning
20491,(d) vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals are many which are used to clone genes in plants and animals
20492,"• in plants, the tumour inducing (ti) plasmid of agrobacterium tumefaciens is used as a cloning vector"
20493,-» it delivers a piece of dna known as t-dna in the ti plasmid which 1 transforms normal plant cells into tumour cells to produce chemicals required by pathogens
20494,"• retrovirus, adenovirus, papillomavirus are also now used as cloning vectors in animals because of their ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells"
20495,"competent host organism (for transformation with recombinant dna) is required because dna being a hydrophilic molecule, cannot pass through cell membranes, hence, the bacteria should be made competent to accept the dna molecules, (i) competency is the ability of a cell to take up foreign dna"
20496,"(a) chemical method in this method, the cell is treated with a specific concentration of | a divalent cation such as calcium to increase pore size in cell wall"
20497,"the cells are then incubated with recombinant dna on ice, followed by placing them briefly at 42°c and then putting it back on ice"
20498,• this enables the bacteria to take up the recombinant dna
20499,"(b) physical methods in this method, a recombinant dna is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell by microinjection method"
20500,"• in plants, cells are bombarded with high velocity microparticles of gold or tungsten coated with dna called as biolistics or gene gun method"
20501,"(c) disarmed pathogen vectors when allowed to infect the cell, transfer the recombinant dna into the host"
20502,"(iii) according to may’s global estimates, only 22% of the total species have been recorded so far"
20503,"if this proportion.is applied to india’s diversity figures, there may be probably more than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species yet to be discovered and described"
20504,patterns of biodiversity indicate that the biodiversity is not uniform throughout the world because it is affected by: (i) latitudinal gradients demonstrates the decrease in species diversity as we move away from the equator towards the poles
20505,(a) tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5°n to 23.5°s) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas
20506,"(b) example, colombia located near the equator has around 1,400 species of birds, while new york at 41°n has 105 species and greenland at 71°n has only 56 species"
20507,"for example, • india with much of its land area in the tropical latitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds"
20508,• a tropical forest in equator has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the midwest of usa
20509,• tropical amazonian rainforest in south america has the greatest biodiversity on earth
20510,"it homes 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427 of mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than 1,25,000 invertebrates"
20511,"• scientists estimate that in these rainforests, there might be at least 2 million insect species waiting to be discovered and named"
20512,(d) reasons for greater biodiversity in tropics • speciation is generally a function of time
20513,"the temperate regions were subjected to frequent glaciation in the past, but the tropics have remained undisturbed and hence, had evolved more species diversity"
20514,"• tropical environments, unlike temperates are less seasonal, relatively more constant and predictable"
20515,such constant environments promote niche specialisation and lead to a greater species diversity
20516,"• more solar energy is available in tropics, which contributes to higher productivity, this in turn might contribute indirectly to greater diversity"
20517,"(ii) species-area relationships (a) alexander von humboldt, a german naturalist and geographer observed that within a region, species richness increased with increasing explored area, but up to a limit"
20518,"(b) in fact, the relation between species richness and area for a wide variety of taxa (like angiosperm plants, birds, bats and freshwater fishes) turn out to be rectangular hyperbola"
20519,"(c) on a logarithmic scale, the relationship is a straight line as given in the following equation log s = log c + z log a where, s = species richness, a=area c = y-intercept, z = slope of the line (regression coefficient) (d) the value of z lies in the range of 0.1-0.2 regardless of taxonomic group or the region"
20520,"(e) if we analyse the species-area relationship among very large areas like the entire continents, the slope of the line will be much steeper, i.e"
20521,"for example, for fruit eating birds and mammals in the tropical forests of different continents, the slope is found to be 1.15"
20522,"importance of species diversity to the ecosystem (i) according to ecologists, communities with more species tend to be more stable than those with less species"
20523,(ii) attributes of a stable community are (a) it should not show too much variation in productivity from year to year
20524,(b) it must be either resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances (natural or man made)
20525,(iii) david tilman’s longterm experiments on ecosystem found that plots with more species showed less year-to-year variation in total biomass
20526,(iv) it is not clear how species richness contributes to the well-being of an ecosystem
20527,"but, it is enough to realise that rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but imperative for the survival of the human race on this planet"
20528,(v) paul ehrlich through his rivet popper hypothesis tried to explain the importance of biodiversity for the survival of species
20529,(a) the hypothesis assumes the ecosystem to be an airplane and the species to be the rivets joining all parts together
20530,"(b) if every passenger pops a rivet to take home (resulting in species extinction), it may not affect the flight safety initially (proper ecosystem functioning) but with time as more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak"
20531,(c) loss of rivet on the wings (key species that drives major ecosystem functions) is a more serious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or windows of the plane
20532,"loss of biodiversity is caused by the over population, urbanisation and industrialisation"
20533,"(i) the colonisation of tropical pacific islands by humans have led to the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds"
20534,"(ii) the iucn red list (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338 vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years"
20535,"(iii) some latest examples of recent extinctions are dodo (mauritius), quagga (africa), thylacine (australia), steller’s sea cow (russia) and three sub-species (bali, javan and caspian) of tiger"
20536,(iv) the last twenty years alone have witnessed the disappearance of 27 species
20537,"(v) presently, 12% of bird species, 23% of all mammal species, 32% of all amphibian species and 31% of all gymnosperm species in the world face the threat of extinction"
20538,(vi) careful analysis of records shows that amphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction
20539,"(vii) the grim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species world wide are facing the threat of extinction"
20540,results of loss of biodiversity in a region (a) decline in plant production
20541,"(c) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes such as plant productivity, water use, pest and disease cycles"
20542,causes of biodiversity losses these are mainly four as given below
20543,"(i) habitat loss and fragmentation (a) the main cause of extinction of species is the destruction of their habitat (b) examples, • tropical rainforests once covering more than 14% of the land surface, now cover only 6% of land area"
20544,• amazon rainforest (called lungs of the planet) is being cut and cleared for the cultivation of soybeans and for conversion to grasslands for raising beef cattle
20545,"(c) when large habitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human activities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain animals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to their population decline"
20546,"(d) the degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species, many have extincted in last 500 years"
20547,(ii) over-exploitation of natural resources by humans results in degradation and extinction of the resources
20548,"for example, steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon and many marine fishes have extincted in last 500 years"
20549,"(iii) alien (exotic) species invasions when alien (exotic) species are introduced unintentionally or deliberately, some become invasive and cause harmful impact resulting in extinction of the indigenous species"
20550,"examples, (a) nile perch a large predator fish when introduced in lake victoria (east africa) caused the extinction of an ecologically unique species of cichlid fish in the lake"
20551,"(b) invasive weed species like parthenium (carrot grass), lantana and eichhornia (water hyacinth) caused environmental damage and pose threat to native species"
20552,"(c) the recent example is of the african cat fish (clarias gariepinus) introduced for aquaculture purpose, is posing a threat to the indigenous cat fishes of indian rivers"
20553,"(iv) co-extinctions when a species become extinct, the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory manner, also become extinct"
20554,"for example, if the host species becomes extinct, all those parasites exclusively found on it will also become extinct"
20555,"in plant pollinator mutualism, extinction of one results in the extinction of the other"

20557,"it is quicker, if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water soluble substances like sugars"
20558,"(v) warm and moist environment speeds up decomposition, whereas low temperature and anaerobiosis inhibits decomposition and causes the formation of organic materials"
20559,(ii) regional and local variations within each biome lead to the formation of a wide variety of habitats
20560,"(iii) life on earth exists in favourable habitats as well as in extreme and harsh habitats like scorching rajasthan desert, rain-soaked meghalaya forests, deep ocean trenches, torrential streams, permafrost polar regions, high mountain tops, boiling thermal springs and stinking compost pits and even in our intestine"
20561,"(iv) the biotic components of a habitat are pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors of the organism with which they interact constantly"

20567,"(e) based on tolerance of temperature range, organisms can be divided as: euiythennal these can tolerate a wide range of temperature"
20568,(ii) water is the next major important factor without which life cannot exist
20569,(a) the productivity and distribution of plants in an environment depends on amount of water available
20570,"(b) for aquatic organisms, the quality (chemical composition and ph) of water is important"
20571,(c) salinity refers to salt concentration (measured in parts per thousand) of water
20572,"salt concentration is less than 5 in land water, 30-35 in sea and more than 100 in some hyper saline lagoons"
20573,"(d) based on tolerance of range of salinity, organisms can be grouped as: euryhaline organisms, which can tolerate a narrow range of salinity"
20574,(e) many freshwater animals cannot live for long in seawater and vice versa because of the osmotic problems they would face
20575,(iii) light is an essential factor for the process of photosynthesis performed by autotrophs
20576,"(b) many small plants like herbs and shrubs can perform photosynthesis under very low light conditions because they are overshadowed by tall, canopied trees"
20577,(c) most of the plants also depend on sunlight to meet their photoperiodic requirement for flowering
20578,"(d) light is also important for many animals as they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light intensity and difration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging, migratory and reproductive activities"
20579,(e) the uv component of solar radiation is harmful to many organisms
20580,all the colour components of the visible spectrum are not available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean

20591,(b) all birds and mammals and few lower vertebrates and invertebrates are capable of thermoregulation and osmoregulation
20592,"(c) in mammals, during summer, sweating occurs profusely and the evaporation brings down temperature of the body"
20593,"(d) in mammals, during winter, shivering occurs which is a kind of exercise that produces heat and raises the body temperature"
20594,"(e) plants, on the other hand, do not have such mechanisms to maintain their internal temperature"
20595,conform (a) about 99% of animals and almost all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment
20596,"(b) in aquatic organisms, the osmotic concentration of the body fluids change with that of the osmotic concentration of the ambient water"
20597,this is specially true for small animals like shrews and humming birds
20598,"since, smal^animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism"
20599,this is the reason that very small animals are rarely found in polar regions

20609,"morphological, physiological or behavioural, that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat"
20610,many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time and are genetically fixed
20611,some examples of adaptations are: (i) adaptations in kangaroo rat (a) the kangaroo rat in north american deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirements by internal oxidation of fat (water is a byproduct) in the absence of water
20612,"(b) it can concentrate its urine, so that minimal volume of water is used to expel excretory products"
20613,(ii) adaptations in desert plants (a) many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata arranged in deep pits to minimise water loss through transpiration
20614,(b) they have special photosynthetic pathway (cam) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time
20615,they are reduced to spines and photosynthesis occurs in flattened stems
20616,(iii) adaptations in mammals (a) mammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs to minimise heat loss

20635,• the velocity of air between the plates must be low enough to allow the dust to fall
20636,(b) scrubber is used to remove harmful gases like sulphur dioxide from industrial exhaust
20637,the exhaust is passed through a spray of water or lime
20638,• water dissolves the gases and lime reacts with sulphur dioxide to form a precipitate of calcium sulphate and sulphide
20639,"* drawbacks recently, the dangers of particulate matter that are very small and cannot be removed by these precipitators has been found"
20640,"according to central pollution control board (cpcb), particulate size 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (pm 2.5) if inhaled can cause breathing and respiratory problems, irritation, damage to lungs and premature deaths"
20641,(c) catalytic convertors are fitted into automobiles for reducing emission of poisonous gases like no2 and co
20642,"• they are made of expensive metals like platinum, palladium and rhodium as catalysts"
20643,"• when exhaust passes through the catalytic convertor, nitric oxide splits into nitrogen and oxygen; carbon monoxide is oxidised into carbon dioxide and unburnt hydrocarbons get burnt completely into co2 and h2o"
20644,• unleaded petrol should be used in motor vehicles fitted with catalytic convertor as leaded petrol inactivates the catalyst

21898,(iv) the reactivity of elements in a group generally decreases downwards
21899,(v) at the end of each period is a noble gas element with a closed valence shell ns2 np6 configuration
21900,d-block elements general electronic configuration: (n -1) d1-10 ns0-2 the d-block elements are known as transition elements because they have incompletely filled d-orbitals in their ground state or in any of the oxidation states
21901,characteristics of d-block elements: (i) they are all metals with high melting and boiling points
21902,(ii) the compounds of the elements are generally paramagnetic in nature
21903,"(iii) they mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states)"
21904,"f-block elements general electronic configuration: (n – 2) f1-14 (n -1) d0-1 ns2 they are known as inner transition elements because in the transition elements of d-block, the electrons are filled in (n – 1) d sub-shell while in the inner transition elements of f-block the filling of electrons takes place in (n – 2) f subshell, which happens to be one inner subshell"
21905,"characteristics of f-block elements: (i) the two rows of elements at the bottom of the periodic table, called the lanthanoids ce (z = 58) – lu (z = 71) and actinoids th (z = 90) – lr (z = 103)"
21906,(ii) these two series of elements are called inner transition elements (f-block elements)
21907,"within each series, the properties of the elements are quite similar"
21908,(iv) most of the elements pf the actinoid series are radio-active in nature
21909,• metals (i) metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on the left side of the periodic table
21910,• non-metals (i) non-metals are located at the top right hand side of the periodic table
21911,(ii) non-metals are usually solids or gases at low temperature with low melting and boiling points
21912,(iv) the non-metallic character increases as one goes from left to right across the periodic table
21913,(v) most non-metallic solids are brittle and are neither malleable nor ductile
21914,"• metalloids the elements (e.g., silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium) show the characteristic, of both metals and non-metals"
21915,• noble gases – these are the elements present in group 18
21916,"– all the members are of gaseous nature and because of the presence of all the occupied filled orbitals, they have very little tendency to take part in chemical combination"
21917,"• representative elements the elements of group 1 (alkali metals), group 2 (alkaline earth metals) and group 13 to 17 constitute the representative elements"
21918,"• transition elements the transition elements include, all the d-block elements and they are present in the centre of the periodic table between s and p-block elements"
21919,• inner transition elements lanthanoids (the fourteen elements after lanthanum) and actinides (the fourteen elements after actinium) are called inner transition elements
21920,• periodic trends in properties of elements trends in physical properties atomic radii: it is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus to the outermost shell containing the electrons
21921,"depending upon whether an element is a non-metal or a metal, three different types of atomic radii are used"
21922,these are: (a) covalent radius (b) ionic radius (c) van der waals radius (d) metallic radius
21923,(a) covalent radius: it is equal to half of the distance between the centres of the nuclei of two atoms held together by a purely covalent single bond
21924,(b) ionic radius: it may be defined as the effictive distance from the nucleus of an ion upto which it has an influence in the ionic bond
21925,(c) van der waals radius: atoms of noble gases are held together by weak van der waals forces of attraction
21926,the van der waals radius is half of the distance between the centre of nuclei of atoms of noble gases
21927,(d) metallic radius: it is defined as half of the intemuclear distance between the two adjacent metal ions in the metallic lattice
21928,"• variation of atomic radius in the periodic table variation in a period: along a period, the atomic radii of the elements generally decreases from left to right"
21929,variation in a group: the atomic radii of the elements in every group of the periodic table increases as we move downwards
21930,• ionic radius the ionic radii can be estimated by measuring the distances between cations and anions in ionic crystals
21931,"in general, the ionic radii of elements exhibit the same trend as the atomic radii"
21932,cation: the removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a cation
21933,the radius of cation is always smaller than that of the atom
21934,the radius of the anion is always larger than that ‘ of the atom
21935,"isoelectronic species: some atoms and ions which contain the same number of electrons, we call them isoelectronic species"
21936,"for example, o2-, f–, na+ and mg2+ have the same number of electrons (10)"
21937,their radii would be different because of their different nuclear charges
21938,• ionization enthalpy it is the energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state
21939,m (g) + i.e ——->m+ (g) + e– the unit of ionization enthalpy is kj mol-1 and the unit of ionization potential is electron volt per atom
21940,"successive ionization enthalpies if a gaseous atom is to lose more than one electron, they can be removed one after the other i.e., in succession and not simultaneously"
21941,"• variation of ionization enthalpies in the periodic table: variation of ionization enthalpy along a period along a period ionization enthalpies are expected to increase in moving across from left to the right, because the nuclear charge increases and the atomic size decreases"
21942,variation of ionization ethalpy in a group the ionization enthalpies of the elements decrease on moving from top to the bottom in any group
21943,the decrease in ionization enthalpies down any group is because of the following factors
21944,(i) there is an increase in the number of the main energy shells (n) in moving from one element to the other
21945,(ii) there is also an increase in the magnitude of the screening effect due to the gradual increase in the number of inner electrons
21946,• electron gain enthalpy electron gain enthalpy is the energy released when an electron is added to an isolated gaseous atom so as to convert it into a negative ion
21947,the process is represented as: for majority of the elements the electron gain enthalpy is negative
21948,"for example, the electron gain enthalpy for halogens is highly negative because they can acquire the nearest noble gas configuration by accepting an extra electron"
21949,"in contrast, noble gases have large positive electron gain enthalpies because the extra electron has to be placed in the next higher principal quantum energy level thereby producing highly unstable electronic configuration"
21950,"successive electron gain enthalpies we have studied that electrons from a gaseous atoms are lost in succession (i.e., one after the other)"
21951,"similarly, these are also accepted one after the other, i.e., in succession"
21952,"after the addition of one electron, the atom becomes negatively charged and the second electron is to be added to a negatively charged ion"
21953,but the addition of second electron is opposed by electrostatic repulsion and hence the energy has to be supplied for the addition of second electron
21954,thus the second electron gain enthalpy of an element is positive
21955,"for example, when an electron is added to oxygen atom to form o– ion, energy is released"
21956,"but when another electron is added to 0- ion to form o2- ion, energy is absorbed to overcome the strong electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged 0– ion and the second electron being added"
21957,"thus, first electron gain enthalpy: factors on which electron gain enthalpy depends (i) atomic size: as the size of an atom increases, the distance between its nucleus and the incoming electron also increases and electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative, (ii) nuclear charge: with the increase in nuclear charge, force of attraction between the nucleus and the incoming electron increases and thus electron gain enthalpy becomes more negative"
21958,(iii) symmetry of the electronic configuration: the atoms with symmetrical configuration (having fully filled or half filled orbitals in the same sub-shell) do not have any urge to take up extra electrons because their configuration will become unstable
21959,in that case the energy will be needed and electron gain enthalpy (δ eg h) will be positive
21960,variation of electron gain enthalpy across a period electron gain ethalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period
21961,variation of electron gain enthalpy in a group electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative as we go down a group
21962,• electronegativity  a qualitative measure of the ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract shared electrons to itself is called electronegativity
21963,"unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy, it is not a measurable quantity"
21964,"however, a number of numerical scales of electronegativity of elements viz, pauling scale, milliken- jaffe scale, allred kochow scale have been developed"
21965,the electronegativity of any given element is not constant; it varies depending on the element to which it is bound
21966,across a period electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right
21967,• periodic trends in chemical properties along a period (i) metallic character: decrease across a period maximum on the extreme left (alkali metals)
21968,(iii) basic nature of oxides: decreases from left to right in a period
21969,(iv) acidic nature of oxides: increases from left to right in a period
21970,• variation from top to bottom on moving down a group (i) metallic character
21971,generally increases because increase in atomic size and hence decrease in the ionizatiort energy of the elements in a group from top to bottom
21972,as electronegativity of elements decreases from top to bottom in a group
21973,since metallic character or electropositivity of elements increases in going from top to bottom in a group basic nature of oxidise naturally increases
21974,generally decreases as non-metallic character of elements decreases in going from top to bottom in a group
21975,"generally decreases down the group, higher the electro-negativity of non-metals, greater is their reactivity"
21976,"since electronegativity of non-metals in a group decreases from top to bottom, their reactivity also decreases"
21977,• anomalous properties of second period elements the first element of each of the group 1 (lithium) and 2 (beryllium) and group 13-17 (boron to fluorine) differs in many respect from the other members of their respective groups
21978,"for example, lithium unlike other alkali metals, and beryllium unlike other alkaline earth metals form compounds which have significant covalent character; the other members of these groups, pre-dominatly form ionic compounds"
21979,"it has been observed that some elements of the second period show similarities with the elements of the third period placed diagonally to each other, though belonging to different groups"
21980,"for example, this similarity in properties of elements placed diagonally to each other is called diagonal relationship"
21981,physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic masses
21982,physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers
21983,the s and p block of elements are known as representative elements
21984,lanthanoids (the fourteen elements after lanthanum) and actinides (the fourteen elements after actinium) are called inner transition elements
21985,general electronic configuration is (n – 2) f1-14(n – 1) d0-1 ns2
21986,mostly located on the right hand side of the periodic table
21987,"elements which line as the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., si, ge, as) are called metalloids or semimetals"
21988,"• atomic radii and ionic radii, increase down the group decrease along the period"
21989,"increases along a period decreases down the group, • chemical reactivity"
21990,chemical reactivity is highest at the two extremess of a period and lowest in the centre
21991,oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of elements on the right are acidic in nature
21992,the electrical discharge through the gases could be observed only at very low pressures and at very high voltages
21993,"when sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles moving in the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode)"
21994,• properties of cathode rays (i) cathode rays travel in straight line
21995,(ii) cathode rays start from cathode and move towards the anode
21996,(iii) these rays themselves are not visible but their behaviour can be observed with the help of certain kind of materials (fluorescent or phosphorescent) which glow when hit by them
21997,"when electric field is applied on the cathode rays with the help of a pair of metal plates, these are found to be deflected towards the positive plate indicating the presence of negative charge"
21998,(v) the characteristics of cathode rays do not depend upon the material of electrodes and the nature of gas present in the cathode ray’tube
21999,thomson for the first time experimentally determined charge/mass ratio called elm ratio for the electrons
22000,"for this, he subjected the beam of electrons released in the discharge tube as cathode rays to influence the electric and magnetic fields"
22001,these were acting perpendicular to one another as well as to the path followed by electrons
22002,"according to thomson, the amount of deviation of the particles from their path in presence of electrical and magnetic field depends upon following factors: (i) greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with the electric or magnetic field and thus greater is the deflection"
22003,"(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the particle, greater the deflection"
22004,(iii) the deflection of electrons from their original path increases with the increase in the voltage across the electrodes or strength of the magnetic field
22005,"by carrying out accurate measurements on the amount of deflections observed by the electrons on the electric field strength or magnetic field strength, thomson was able to determine the value of e/me = 1.758820 x 1011 c kg-1 where me = mass of the electron in kg e = magnitude of charge on the electron in coulomb (c)"
22006,millikan devised a method known as oil drop experiment to determine the charge on the electrons
22007,"• discovery of proton—anode rays in 1886, goldstein modified the discharge tube by using a perforated cathode"
22008,"on reducing the pressure, he observed a new type of luminous rays passing through the holes or perforations of the cathode and moving in a direction opposite to the cathode rays"
22009,these rays were named as positive rays or anode rays or as canal rays
22010,anode rays are not emitted from the anode but from a space between anode and cathode
22011,• properties of anode rays (i) the value of positive charge (e) on the particles constituting anode rays depends upon the nature of the gas in the discharge tube
22012,(ii) the charge to mass ratio of the particles is found to depend on the gas from which these originate
22013,(iii) some of the positively charged particles carry a multiple of the fundamental unit of electrical charge
22014,(iv) the behaviour of these particles in the magnetic or electric field is opposite to that observed for electron or cathode rays
22015,• proton the smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called proton
22016,mass of proton = 1.676 x 10-27 kg charge on a proton = (+) 1.602 x 10-19 c • neutron it is a neutral particle
22017,by the bombardment of thin sheets of beryllium with fast moving a-particles he observed • that highly penetrating rays consist of neutral particles which were named neutrons
22018,thomson proposed that an atom may be regarded as a sphere of approximate radius 1ct8 cm carrying positive charge due to protons and in which negatively charged electrons are embedded
22019,"(ii) in this model, the atom is visualized as a pudding or cake of positive charge with electrons embedded into it"
22020,(iii) the mass of atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom according to this model
22021,"drawback of thomson model of atom this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, it could not satisfactorily, explain the results of scattering experiments carried out by rutherford in 1911"
22022,"• rutherford’s a-particle scattering experiment rutherford in 1911, performed some scattering experiments in which he bombarded thin foils of metals like gold, silver, platinum or copper with a beam of fast moving a-particles"
22023,the thin gold foil had a circular fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it
22024,"whenever a-particles struck the screen, a tiny flash of light was produced at that point"
22025,"from these experiments, he made the following observations: – (i) most of the a-particles passed through the foil without undergoing any deflection, (ii) a few a-particles underwent deflection through small angles"
22026,"(iii) very few mere deflected back i.e., through an angle of nearly 180°"
22027,"from these observations, rutherford drew the following conclusions: (i) since most of the a-particles passed through the foil without undergoing any deflection, there must be sufficient empty space within the atom"
22028,(ii) a small fraction of a-particles was deflected by small angles
22029,the positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small volume that repelled and deflected a few positively charged a-particles
22030,(iii) the volume of nucleus is very small as compared to total volume of atom
22031,• rutherford’s nuclear model of an atom (i) the positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was densely concentrated in an extremely small region
22032,this very small portion of the atom was called nucleus by rutherford
22033,(ii) the nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called orbits
22034,(iii) electrons and nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction
22035,• atomic number the number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to the atomic number (z)
22036,"for example, the number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore, their atomic numbers are 1 and 11"
22037,"in order to keep the electrical neutrality, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, z)"
22038,"for example, number of electrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively"
22039,atomic number (z) = number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
22040,• mass number number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons
22041,the total number of nucleons is termed as mass number (a) of the atom
22042,mass number (a) = number of protons (p) + number of neutrons (n)
22043,• isotopes atoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as isotopes
22044,"(ii) since, the isotopes differ in their atomic masses, all the properties of the isotopes depending upon the mass are different"
22045,"(iii) since, the chemical properties are mainly determined by the number of protons in the nucleus, and the number of electrons in the atom, the different isotopes of an element exhibit similar chemical properties"
22046,"for example, all the isotopes of carbon on burning give carbon dioxide"
22047,"• isobars • drawbacks of rutherford model (i) when a body is moving in an orbit, it achieves acceleration"
22048,"thus, an electron moving around nucleus in an orbit is under acceleration"
22049,"according to maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, charged particles when accelerated must emit electromagnetic radiations"
22050,"therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiations, the energy carried by radiation comes from electronic motion"
22051,its path will become closer to nucleus and ultimately should spiral into nucleus within
22052,"thus, rutherford’s model cannot explain the stability of atom if the motion of electrons is described on the basis of classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory"
22053,(ii) rutherford’s model does not give any idea about distribution of electrons around the nucleus and about their energies
22054,• developments leading to the bohr’s model of atom two developments played a major role in the formulation of bohr’s model of atom
22055,these were: (i) dual character of the electromagnetic radiation which means that radiations possess both wave like and particle like properties
22056,(ii) experimental results regarding atomic spectra which can be explained only by assuming quantized electronic energy levels in atoms
22057,• nature of electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetic wave theory) this theory was put forward by james clark maxwell in 1864
22058,the main points of this theory are as follows: (i) the energy is emitted from any source (like the heated rod or the filament of a bulb through which electric current is passed) continuously in the form of radiations and is called the radiant energy
22059,(ii) the radiations consist of electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and both perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the radiation
22060,(iii) the radiations possess wave character and travel with the velocity of light 3 x 108 m/sec
22061,(iv) these waves do not require any material medium for propagation
22062,"for example, rays from the sun reach us through space which is a non-material medium"
22063,• characteristics of a wave wavelength: it is defined as the distance between any two consecutive crests or troughs
22064,frequency: frequency of a wave is defined as the number of waves passing through a point in one second
22065,it is represented by v (nu) and is expressed in hertz (hz)
22066,velocity: velocity of a wave is defined as the linear distance travelled by the wave in one second
22067,it is represented by c and is expressed in cm/sec or m/sec
22068,amplitude: amplitude of a wave is the height of the crest or the depth of the through
22069,it is represented by v and is expressed in the units of length
22070,wave number: it is defined as the number of waves present in 1 metre length
22071,evidently it will be equal to the reciprocal of the wavelength
22072,"electromagnetic spectrum: when electromagnetic radiations are arranged in order of their increasing wavelengths or decreasing frequencies, the complete spectrum obtained is called electromagnetic spectrum"
22073,"• limitations of electromagnetic wave theory electromagnetic wave theory was successful in explaining properties of light such as interference, diffraction etc; but it could not explain the following: (i) the phenomenon of black body radiation"
22074,(iii) the variation of heat capacity of solids as a function of temperature
22075,"• black body radiation the ideal body, which emits and absorbs all frequencies is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation"
22076,exact frequency distribution of the emitted radiation from a black body depends only on its temperature
22077,"at a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with decrease of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further decrease of wavelength as shown in fig 2.6"
22078,"• planck’s quantum theory to explain the phenomenon of ‘black body radiation’ and photoelectric effect, max planck in 1900, put forward a theory known as planck’s quantum theory"
22079,"the main points of this theory was as follows: , (i) the radiant energy emitted or absorbed in the form of small packets of energy"
22080,"(ii) the energy of each quantum is directly proportional to the frequency of the radiation where h is a proportionality constant, called planck’s constant"
22081,"• photoelectric effect hertz, in 1887, discovered that when a beam of light of certain frequency strikes the surface of some metals, electrons are emitted or ejected from the metal surface"
22082,observations in photoelectric effect (i) only photons of light of certain minimum frequency called threshold frequency (v0) can cause the photoelectric effect
22083,(ii) the kinetic energy of the electrons which are emitted is directly proportional to the frequency of the striking photons and is quite independent of their intensity
22084,(iii) the number of electrons that are ejected per second from the metal surface depends upon the intensity of the striking photons or radiations and not upon their frequency
22085,"explanation of photoelectric effect einstein in (1905) was able to give an explanation of the different points of the photoelectric effect using planck’s quantum theory as under: (i) photoelectrons are ejected only when the incident light has a certain minimum frequency (threshold frequency v0) (ii) if the frequency of the incident light (v) is more than the threshold frequency (v0), the excess energy (hv – hv0) is imparted to the electron as kinetic energy"
22086,"(iii) on increasing the intensity of light, more electrons are ejected but the energies of the electrons are not altered"
22087,"• dual behaviour of electromagnetic radiation from the study of behaviour of light, scientists came to the conclusion that light and other electromagnetic radiations have dual nature"
22088,"whenever radiation interacts with matter, it displays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction) which it exhibits when it propagates"
22089,• spectrum when a ray of white light is passed through a prism the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength
22090,"since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, array of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum"
22091,"the light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most"
22092,continuous spectrum when a ray of white light is analysed by passing through a prism it is observed that it splits up into seven different wide bands of colours from violet to red (like rainbow)
22093,these colours are so continuous that each of them merges into the next
22094,emission spectra emission spectra is noticed when the radiations emitted from a source are passed through a prism and then received on the photographic plate
22095,radiations can be emitted in a number of ways such as: (i) from sun or glowing electric bulb
22096,(ii) by passing electric discharge through a gas at low pressure
22097,line spectra when the vapours of some volatile substance are allowed to fall on the flame of a bunsen burner and then analysed with the help of a spectroscope
22098,some specific coloured lines appear on the photographic plate which are different for different substances
22099,"for example, sodium or its salts emit yellow light while potassium or its salts give out violet light"
22100,"absorption spectra when white light is passed through the vapours of a substance and the transmitted light is then allowed to strike a prism, dark lines appear in the otherwise continuous spectrum"
22101,the dark lines indicate that the radiations corresponding to them were absorbed by the substance from the white light
22102,dark lines appear exactly at the same positions where the lines in the emission spectra appear
22103,"• line spectrum of hydrogen when electric discharge is passed through hydrogen gas enclosed in discharge tube under low pressure and the emitted light is analysed by a spectroscope, the spectrum consists of a large number of lines which are grouped into different series"
22104,"on the basis of experimental observations, johannes rydberg noted that all series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum could be described by the following expression: rydberg in 1890, and has given a simple theoretical equation for the calculation of wavelengths and wave numbers of the spectral lines in different series of hydrogen spectrum"
22105,"for other species, where z is the atomic number of the species"
22106,"here rh = constant, called rydberg constant for hydrogen and n1 , n2 are integers (n2 > n1) for any particular series, the value of n1 is constant while that of n2 changes"
22107,"for example, for lyman series, n1= 1, n2= 2, 3, 4, 5………."
22108,"for balmer series, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, 4, 5, 6………."
22109,"for paschen series, n1= 3, n2 = 4, 5, 6, 7………."
22110,"for brackett series,n1 = 4, n2 = 5, 6, 7, 8………."
22111,"for pjund series, n1 =5, n2 = 6, 7, 8, 9………."
22112,"thus, by substituting the values of n1 and n2 in the above equation, wavelengths and wave number of different spectral lines can be calculated"
22113,"when n1 = 2, the expression given above is called balmer’s formula"
22114,"• bohr’s model of atom niels bohr in 1913, proposed a new model of atom on the basis of planck’s quantum theory"
22115,"the main points of this model are as follows: (i) in an atom, the electrons revolve around the nucleus in certain definite circular paths called orbits"
22116,(ii) each orbit is associated with definite energy and therefore these are known as energy levels or energy shells
22117,"(iii) only those energy orbits are permitted for the electron in which angular momentum of the electron is a whole number multiple of h/2π angular momentum of electron (mvr) = nh/2π (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 etc)"
22118,"(iv) as long as electron is present in a particular orbit, it neither absorbs nor loses energy and its energy, therefore, remains constant"
22119,"(v) when energy is supplied to an electron, it absorbs energy only in fixed amounts as quanta and jumps to higher energy state away from the nucleus known as excited state"
22120,"the excited state is unstable, the electron may jump back to the lower energy state and in doing so, it emits the same amount of energy"
22121,bohr’s theory has helped in calculating the energy of electron in hydrogen atom and one electron species
22122,• limitations of bohr’s model (i) the theory could not explain the atomic spectra of the atoms containing more than one electron or multielectron atoms
22123,(ii) bohr7s theory failed to explain the fine structure of the spectral lines
22124,(iii) bohr’s theory could not offer any satisfactory explanation of zeeman effect and stark effect
22125,(iv) bohr’s theory failed to explain the ability of atoms to form molecule formed by chemical bonds
22126,(v) it was not in accordance with the heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
22127,"• dual behaviour of matter (de broglie equation) de broglie in 1924, proposed that matter, like radiation, should also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle like and wave like properties"
22128,"this means that like photons, electrons also have momentum as well as wavelength"
22129,"from this analogy, de broglie gave the following relation between wavelength (λ) and momentum (p) of a material particle"
22130,"• heisenberg’s uncertainty principle it states that, “it is impossible to determine simultaneously, the exact position and exact momentum (or velocity) of an electron”"
22131,• significance of uncertainty principle (i) it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles
22132,(ii) the effect of heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is significant only for microscopic objects and is negligible for macroscopic objects
22133,• reasons for the failure of bohr model (i) the wave character of the electron is not considered in bohr model
22134,(ii) according to bohr model an orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the position and the velocity of the electron are known exactly at the same time
22135,• quantum mechanical model of atom quantum mechanics: quantum mechanics is a theoretical science that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties
22136,"important features of quantum mechanical model of atom (i) the energy of electrons in atom is quantized i.e., can only have certain values"
22137,(ii) the existence of quantized electronic energy level is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons
22138,(iii) both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in an atom cannot be determined simultaneously
22139,all the information about the electron in an atom is stored in orbital wave function φ
22140,"(v) the probability of finding electron at a point within an atom is proportional to square of orbital wave function i.e., |φ2|at that point"
22141,"from the value of φ2 at different points within atom, it is possible to predict the region around the nucleus where electron most probably will be found"
22142,"• quantum numbers atomic orbitals can be specified by giving their corresponding energies and angular momentums which are quantized (i.e., they have specific values)"
22143,the quantized values can be expressed in terms of quantum number
22144,"these are used to get complete information about electron i.e., its location, energy, spin etc"
22145,principal quantum number (n) it is the most important quantum number since it tells the principal energy level or shell to which the electron belongs
22146,"it is denoted by the letter v and can have any integral value except zero, i.e., n = 1, 2, 3, 4………."
22147,"the various principal energy shells are also designated by the letters, k, l, m, n, o, p …."
22148,the principal quantum number gives us the following information: (i) it gives the average distance of the electron from the nucleus
22149,(ii) it completely determines the energy of the electron in hydrogen atom and hydrogen like particles
22150,(iii) the maximum number of electrons present in any principal shell is given by 2n2 where n is the number of the principal shell
22151,azimuthal or subsidiary or orbital angular quantum number (l) it is found that the spectra of the elements contain not only the main lines but there are many fine lines also present
22152,this number helps to explain the fine lines of the spectrum
22153,the azimuthal quantum number gives the following information: (i) the number of subshells present in the main shell
22154,(ii) the angular momentum of the electron present in any subshell
22155,(iv) the shapes of the various subshells present within the same principal shell
22156,"for a given value of n, it can have any value ranging from 0 to n – 1"
22157,"for example, for the 1st shell (k), n = 1, l can have only one value i.e., l = 0 for n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0 and 1"
22158,subshells corresponding to different values of l are represented by the following symbols: value of l 0 1 2 3 4 5 …………….
22159,magnetic orbital quantum number (m or m1) the magnetic orbital quantum number determines the number of preferred orientations of the electrons present in a subshell
22160,"since each orientation corresponds to an orbital, therefore, the magnetic orbital quantum number determines the number of orbitals present in any subshell"
22161,"the magnetic quantum number is denoted by letter m or ml and for a given value of l, it can have all the values ranging from – l to + l including zero"
22162,"thus, for energy value of l, m has 2l + 1 values"
22163,"for example, for l = 0 (s-subshell), ml can have only one value i.e., m1 = 0"
22164,spin quantum number (s or ms) this quantum number helps to explain the magnetic properties of the substances
22165,a spinning electron behaves like a micromagnet with a definite magnetic moment
22166,"if an orbital contains two electrons, the two magnetic moments oppose and cancel each other"
22167,"thus, s-orbital with only one orientation has a spherical shape with uniform electron density along all the three axes"
22168,the probability of is electron is found to be maximum near the nucleus and decreases with the increase in the distance from the nucleus
22169,"in 2s electron, the probability is also maximum near the nucleus and decreases to zero probability"
22170,the spherical empty shell for 2s electron is called nodal surface or simply node
22171,"• shapes of p-orbitals p-orbitals are present in the p-subshell for which l = 1 and m1 can have three possible orientations – 1, 0, + 1"
22172,"thus, there are three orbitals in the p-subshell which are designated as px, py and pz orbitals depending upon the axis along which they are directed"
22173,the general shape of a p-orbital is dumb-bell consisting of two portions known as lobes
22174,"moreover, there is a plane passing through the nucleus along which finding of the electron density is almost nil"
22175,this is known as nodal plane as shown in the fig
22176,"from the dumb-bell pictures, it is quite obvious that unlike s-orbital, a p-orbital is directional in nature and hence it influences the shapes of the molecules in the formation of which it participates"
22177,"• shapes of d-orbitals d-orbitals are present in d-subshell for which l = 2 and m[ = -2, -1, 0, +1 and +2"
22178,this means that there are five orientations leading to five different orbitals
22179,"• aufbau principle the principle states: in the ground state of the atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies"
22180,"in other words, electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital available to them and enter into higher energy orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are filled"
22181,"the order in which the energies of the orbitals increase and hence the order in which the orbitals are filled is as follows: is, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, id, 5p, 6s, if, 3d, 6p, 7s, 5f 6d, 7p the order may be remembered by using the method given in fig"
22182,"• pauli exclusion principle according to this principle, no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers"
22183,pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as: only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spins
22184,"• hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity it states that: pairing of electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell (p, d or f) does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each i.e., it is singly occupied"
22185,• electronic configuration of atoms the distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration
22186,the electronic configuration of different atoms can be represented in two ways
22187,for example: • causes of stability of completely filled and half filled subshells the completely filled and half filled subshells are stable due to the following reasons: 1
22188,symmetrical distribution of electrons: the completely filled or half filled subshells have symmetrical distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable
22189,the stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with same spin are present in the degenrate orbitals of a subshell
22190,these electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to their exchange is called exchange energy
22191,the number of exchanges that can takes place is maximum when the subshell is either half filled or completely filled
22192,-as a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability
22193,• properties of matter and their measurements physical properties: those properties which can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance
22194,"some examples of physical properties are colour, odour, melting point, boiling point etc"
22195,the examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances
22196,"• units of measurement fundamental units: the quantities mass, length and time are called fundamental quantities and their units are known as fundamental units"
22197,"there are seven basic units of measurement for the quantities: length, mass, time, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and luminous intensity"
22198,si-system: this system of measurement is the most common system employed throughout the world
22199,it has given units of all the seven basic quantities listed above
22200,metre: it is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second
22201,it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram
22202,"second: it is the duration of 9192631, 770 periods of radiation which correspond to the transition between the two hyper fine levels of the ground state of caesium- 133 atom"
22203,kelvin: it is the unit of thermodynamic temperature and is equal to 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water
22204,"ampere: the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section and placed, 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-7 n per metre of length"
22205,"candela: it may be defined as the luminous intensity in a given direction, from a source which emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/ 683 watt per steradian"
22206,mole: it is the amount of substance which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon -12
22207,• mass and weight mass: mass of a substance is the amount of matter present in it
22208,the mass of a substance can be determined accurately in the laboratory by using an analytical balance
22209,weight: it is the force exerted by gravity on an object
22210,weight of substance may vary from one place to another due to change in gravity
22211,"however, a popular unit of measuring volume, particularly in liquids is litre (l) but it is not in si units or an s.i"
22212,"volume of liquids can be measured by different devices like burette, pipette, cylinder, measuring flask etc"
22213,temperature: there are three scales in which temperature can be measured
22214,"these are known as celsius scale (°c), fahrenheit scale (°f) and kelvin scale (k)"
22215,-> thermometres with celsius scale are calibrated from 0°c to 100°c
22216,-> thermometres with fahrenheit scale are calibrated from 32°f to 212°f
22217,scale and is very common these days.temperature on this scale is shown by the sign k
22218,the temperature on two scales are related to each other by the relationship density: density of a substance is its amount of mass per unit volume
22219,"so, si unit of density can be obtained as follows: this unit is quite large and a chemist often expresses density in g cm3 where mass is expressed in gram and volume is expressed in cm3"
22220,• uncertainty in measurements all scientific measurements involve certain degree of error or uncertainty
22221,(i) skill and accuracy of the worker (ii) limitations of measuring instruments
22222,• scientific notation it is an exponential notation in which any number can be represented in the form n x 10n where n is an exponent having positive or negative values and n can vary between 1 to 10
22223,"thus, 232.508 can be written as 2.32508 x 102 in scientific notation"
22224,now let us see how calculations are carried out with numbers expressed in scientific notation
22225,"(i) calculation involving multiplication and division (ii) calculation involving addition and subtraction: for these two operations, the first numbers are written in such a way that they have the same exponent"
22226,"after that, the coefficients are added or subtracted as the case may be"
22227,"for example, • significant figures significant figures are meaningful digits which are known with certainty"
22228,there are certain rules for determining the number of significant figures
22229,"for example, in 285 cm, there are three significant figures and in 0.25 ml, there are two significant figures"
22230,"for example, 0.03 has one significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures"
22231,zeros at the end or right of a number are significant provided they are on the right side of the decimal point
22232,"for example, 2 balls or 20 eggs have infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and can be represented by writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal"
22233,"i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000 • addition and subtraction of significant figures in addition or subtraction of the numbers having different precisions, the final result should be reported to the same number of decimal places as in the term having the least number of decimal places"
22234,"for example, let us carry out the addition of three numbers 3.52, 2.3 and 6.24, having different precisions or different number of decimal places"
22235,"the final result has two decimal places but the answer has to be reported only up to one decimal place, i.e., the answer would be 12.0"
22236,subtraction of numbers can be done in the same way as the addition
22237,"but it has to be reported only up to two decimal places, i.e., the answer would be 11.36"
22238,"• multiplication and division of significant figures in the multiplication or division, the final result should be reported upto the same number of significant figures as present in the least precise number"
22239,"multiplication of numbers: 2.2120 x 0.011 = 0.024332 according to the rule the final result = 0.024 division of numbers: 4.2211÷3.76 = 1.12263 the correct answer = 1.12 • dimensional analysis often while calculating, there is a need to convert units from one system to other"
22240,the method used to accomplish this is called factor label method or unit factor method or dimensional analysis
22241,• laws of chemical combinations the combination of elements to form compounds is governed by the following five basic laws
22242,"(i) law of conservation of mass (ii) law of definite proportions (iii) law of multiple proportions (iv) law of gaseous volume (gay lussac’s law) (v) avogadro’s law (i) law of conservation of mass the law was established by a french chemist, a"
22243,"the law states: in all physical and chemical changes, the total mass of the reactants is equal to that of the products"
22244,it is found that there is no change in weight though a physical change has taken place
22245,"during the above decomposition reaction, matter is neither gained nor lost"
22246,(ii) law of definite proportions according to this law: a pure chemical compound always consists of the same elements combined together in a fixed proportion by weight
22247,"for example, carbon dioxide may be formed in a number of ways i.e., (iii) law of multiple proportions if two elements combine to form two or more compounds, the weight of one of the elements which combines with a fixed weight of the other in these compounds, bears simple whole number ratio by weight"
22248,"for example, (iv) gay lussac’s law of gaseous volumes the law states that, under similar conditions of temperature and pressure, whenever gases combine, they do so in volumes which bear simple whole number ratio with each other and also with the gaseous products"
22249,(a) combination between hydrogen and chlorine: (b) combination between nitrogen and hydrogen: the two gases lead to the formation of ammonia gas under suitable conditions
22250,"the chemical equation is (v) avogadro’s law: avogadro proposed that, equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure should contain equal number of molecules"
22251,"for example, if we consider the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, we see that two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water without leaving any unreacted oxygen"
22252,"• dalton’s atomic theory in 1808, dalton published ‘a new system of chemical philosophy’ in which he proposed the following: 1"
22253,all the atoms of a given element have identical properties including identical mass
22254,compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio
22255,• atomic mass the atomic mass of an element is the number of times an atom of that element is heavier than an atom of carbon taken as 12
22256,it may be noted that the atomic masses as obtained above are the relative atomic masses and not the actual masses of the atoms
22257,one atomic mass unit (amu) is equal to l/12th of the mass of an atom of carbon-12 isotope
22258,average atomic mass most of the elements exist as isotopes which are different atoms of the same element with different mass numbers and the same atomic number
22259,"therefore, the atomic mass of an element must be its average atomic mass and it may be defined as the average relative mass of an atom of an element as compared to the mass of carbon atoms (c-12) taken as 12w"
22260,molecular mass molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of the elements present in a molecule
22261,it is obtained by multiplying the atomic mass of each element by number of its atoms and adding them together
22262,"for example, molecular mass of methane (ch4) = 12.011 u + 4 (1.008 u) = 16.043 u formula mass ionic compounds such as nacl, kno3, na2c03 etc"
22263,"do not consist of molecules i.e., single entities but exist “as ions closely packed together in a three dimensional space as shown in -fig"
22264,"in such cases, the formula is used to calculate the formula mass instead of molecular mass"
22265,"thus, formula mass of nacl = atomic mass of sodium + atomic mass of chlorine = 23.0 u + 35.5 u = 58.5 u"
22266,• mole concept it is found that one gram atom of any element contains the same number of atoms and one gram molecule of any substance contains the same number of molecules
22267,this number has been experimentally determined and found to be equal to 6.022137 x 1023 the value is generally called avogadro’s number or avogadro’s constant
22268,"it is usually represented by na: avogadro’s number, na = 6.022 × 1023 • percentage composition one can check the purity of a given sample by analysing this data"
22269,"since water contains hydrogen and oxygen, the percentage composition of both these elements can be calculated as follows: • empirical formula the formula of the compound which gives the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms of yarious elements present in one molecule of the compound"
22270,"in order to express its empirical formula, we have to take out a common factor 2"
22271,the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms is 1:1 and the empirical formula is ho
22272,"in order to get the simplest whole number of the atoms, common factor = 6 the ratio is = 1 : 2 : 1 the empirical formula of glucose = ch20 • molecular formula the formula of a compound which gives the actual ratio of the atoms of various elements present in one molecule of the compound"
22273,"for example, molecular formula of hydrogen peroxide = h202and glucose = c6h1206 molecular formula = n x empirical formula where n is the common factor and also called multiplying factor"
22274,"the value of n may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc"
22275,"in case n is 1, molecular formula of a compound = empirical formula of the compound"
22276,• stoichiometry and stoichiometric calculations the word ‘stoichiometry’ is derived from two greek words—stoicheion (meaning element) and metron (meaning measure)
22277,"stoichiometry, thus deals with the calculation of masses (sometimes volume also) of the reactants and the products involved in a chemical reaction"
22278,"a balanced equation for this reaction is as given below: limiting reactant/reagent sometimes, in alchemical equation, the reactants present are not the amount as required according to the balanced equation"
22279,the amount of products formed then depends upon the reactant which has reacted completely
22280,this reactant which reacts completely in the reaction is called the limiting reactant or limiting reagent
22281,the reactant which is not consumed completely in the reaction is called excess reactant
22282,"reactions in solutions when the reactions are carried out in solutions, the amount of substance present in its given volume can be expressed in any of the following ways: 1"
22283,mass percent: it is obtained by using the following relation: 2
22284,mole fraction: it is the ratio of number of moles of a particular component to the total number of moles of the solution
22285,"for a solution containing n2 moles of the solute dissolved in n1 moles of the solvent, 3"
22286,molarity: it is defined as the number of moles of solute in 1 litre of the solution
22287,molality: it is defined as the number of moles of solute present in 1 kg of solvent
22288,"• all substances contain matter which can exist in three states — solid, liquid or gas"
22289,"• matter can also be classified into elements, compounds and mixtures"
22290,• element: an element contains particles of only one type which may be atoms or molecules
22291,• compounds are formed when atoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other
22292,• mixtures: many of the substances present around us are mixtures
22293,• scientific notation: the measurement of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide rhnge of 10-31to 1023
22294,"hence, a convenient system of expressing the number in scientific notation is used"
22295,• scientific figures: the uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant figures in which the observations are reported
22296,• dimensional analysis: it helps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units
22297,• laws of chemical combinations are: (i) law of conservation of mass (ii) law of definite proportions (iii) law of multiple proportions (iv) gay lussac’s law of gaseous volumes (v) avogadro’s law
22298,• atomic mass: the atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12c isotope of carbon which has an exact value of 12u
22299,• average atomic mass: obtained by taking into account the natural aboundance of different isotopes of that element
22300,• molecular mass: the molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule
22301,"• avogadro number: the number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are expressed in terms of avogadro constant"
22302,= 6.022 x 1023 • balanced chemical equation: a balanced equation has the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation
22303,• stoichiometry: the quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called stoichiometry
22304,"using stoichiometric calculations, the amounts of one or more reactants required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa"
22305,• modes of chemical combination — by the transfer of electrons: the chemical bond which formed by the complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another is termed as electrovalent bond or ionic bond
22306,— by sharing of electrons: the bond which is formed by the equal sharing of electrons between one or two atoms is called covalent bond
22307,"— co-ordinate bond: when the electrons are contributed by one atom and shared by both, the bond is formed and it is known as dative bond or co-ordinate bond"
22308,• ionic or electrovalent bond ionic or electrovalent bond is formed by the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another
22309,we can say that it is the electrostatic force of attraction which holds the oppositely charged ions together
22310,the compounds which is formed by ionic or electrovalent bond is known as electrovalent compounds
22311,formation of nacl is given below: na+ ion has the configuration of ne while cl– ion represents the configuration of ar
22312,electrovalency: electrovalency is the number of electrons lost or gained during the formation of an ionic bond or electrovalent bond
22313,• factors affecting the formation of ionic bond (i) ionization enthalpy: as we know that ionization enthalpy of any element is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from outermost shell of an isolated gaseous atom to convert it into cation
22314,"hence, lesser the ionization enthalpy, easier will be the formation of a cation and have greater chance to form an ionic bond"
22315,due to this reason alkali metals have more tendency to form an ionic bond
22316,"for example, in formation of na+ ion i.e = 496 kj/mole while in case of magnesium, it is 743 kj/mole"
22317,that’s why the formation of positive ion for sodium is easier than that of magnesium
22318,"therefore, we can conclude that lower the ionization enthalpy, greater the chances of ionic bond formation"
22319,(ii) electron gain enthalpy (electron affinities): it is defined as the energy released when an isolated gaseous atom takes up an electron to form anion
22320,"greater the negative electron gain enthalpy, easier will be the formation of anion"
22321,(iii) lattice energy or enthalpy: it is defined as the amount of energy required to separate 1 mole of ionic compound into separate oppositely charged ions
22322,"lattice energy of an ionic compound depends upon following factors: (i) size of the ions: smaller the size, greater will be the lattice energy"
22323,"(ii) charge on the ions: greater the magnitude of charge, greater the interionic attraction and hence higher the lattice energy"
22324,"• general characteristics of ionic compounds (i) physical’state: they generally exist as crystalline solids, known as crystal lattice"
22325,"(ii) melting and boiling points: since ionic compounds contain high interionic force between them, they generally have high melting and boiling points"
22326,"(iii) solubility: they are soluble in polar solvents such as water but do not dissolve in organic solvents like benzene, ccl4etc"
22327,"(iv) electrical conductivity: in solid state they are poor conductors of electricity but in molten state or when dissolved in water, they conduct electricity"
22328,(v) ionic reactions: ionic compounds produce ions in the solution which gives very fast reaction with oppositely charged ions
22329,"for example, • covalent bond—lewis-langmuir concept when the bond is formed between two or more atoms by mutual contribution and sharing of electrons, it is known as covalent bond"
22330,if the combining atoms are same the covalent molecule is known as homoatomic
22331,(ii) each anion means addition of one electron and each cation means removal of one electron
22332,"(iv) after placing shared pairs of electrons for single bond, the remaining electrons may account for either multiple bonds or as lone pairs"
22333,it is to be noted that octet of each atom should be completed
22334,"• formal charge in polyatomic ions, the net charge is the charge on the ion as a whole and not by particular atom"
22335,"for example, li, be and b have 1, 2, and 3 valence electrons only"
22336,(ii) odd-electron molecules: there are certain molecules which have odd number of electrons the octet rule is not applied for all the atoms
22337,(iii) the expanded octet: in many compounds there are more than eight valence electrons around the central atom
22338,(ii) this theory does not account for the shape of the molecule
22339,(iii) it does not give any idea about the energy of the molecule and relative stability
22340,• bond length it is defined as the equilibrium distance between the centres of the nuclei of the two bonded atoms
22341,"experimentally, it can be defined by x-ray diffraction or electron diffraction method"
22342,• bond angle it is defined as -the angle between the lines representing the orbitals containing the bonding – electrons
22343,• bond enthalpy it is defined as the amount of energy required to break one mole of bonds of a particular type to separate them into gaseous atoms
22344,bond enthalpy is also known as bond dissociation enthalpy or simple bond enthalpy
22345,"unit of bond enthalpy = kj mol-1 greater the bond enthalpy, stronger is the bond"
22346,"for e.g., the h—h bond enthalpy in hydrogen is 435.8 kj mol-1"
22347,the magnitude of bond enthalpy is also related to bond multiplicity
22348,"for e.g., bond enthalpy of c —c bond is 347 kj mol-1 while that of c = c bond is 610 kj mol-1"
22349,"in polyatomic molecules, the term mean or average bond enthalpy is used"
22350,"• bond order according to lewis, in a covalent bond, the bond order is given by the number of bonds between two atoms in a molecule"
22351,"for example, bond order of h2 (h —h) =1 bond order of 02 (o = o) =2 bond order of n2 (n = n) =3 isoelectronic molecules and ions have identical bond orders"
22352,"with the increase in bond order, bond enthalpy increases and bond length decreases"
22353,"for example, • resonance structures there are many molecules whose behaviour cannot be explained by a single-lew is structure, tor example, lewis structure of ozone represented as follows: thus, according to the concept of resonance, whenever a single lewis structure cannot explain all the properties of the molecule, the molecule is then supposed to have many structures with similar energy"
22354,"positions of nuclei, bonding and nonbonding pairs of electrons are taken as the canonical structure of the hybrid which describes the molecule accurately"
22355,"for 03, the two structures shown above are canonical structures and the iii structure represents the structure of 03 more accurately"
22356,"some resonating structures of some more molecules and ions are shown as follows: • polarity of bonds polar and non-polar covalent bonds non-polar covalent bonds: when the atoms joined by covalent bond are the same like; h2, 02, cl2, the shared pair of electrons is equally attracted by two atoms and thus the shared electron pair is equidistant to both of them"
22357,"alternatively, we can say that it lies exactly in the centre of the bonding atoms"
22358,"as a result, no poles are developed and the bond is called as non-polar covalent bond"
22359,"for example, polar bond: when covalent bonds formed between different atoms of different electronegativity, shared electron pair between two atoms gets displaced towards highly electronegative atoms"
22360,"for example, in hcl molecule, since electronegativity of chlorine is high as compared to hydrogen thus, electron pair is displaced more towards chlorine atom, thus chlorine will acquire a partial negative charge (δ–) and hydrogen atom have a partial positive charge (δ+) with the magnitude of charge same as on chlorination"
22361,"• dipole moment due to polarity, polar molecules are also known as dipole molecules and they possess dipole moment"
22362,dipole moment is defined as the product of magnitude of the positive or negative charge and the distance between the charges
22363,• applications of dipole moment (i) for determining the polarity of the molecules
22364,"for example, the molecules with zero dipole moment will be linear or symmetrical"
22365,those molecules which have unsymmetrical shapes will be either bent or angular
22366,"• the valence shell electron pair repulsion (vsepr) theory sidgwick and powell in 1940, proposed a simple theory based on repulsive character of electron pairs in the valence shell of the atoms"
22367,main postulates are the following: (i) the exact shape of molecule depends upon the number of electron pairs (bonded or non bonded) around the central atoms
22368,(ii) the electron pairs have a tendency to repel each other since they exist around the central atom and the electron clouds are negatively charged
22369,(iii) electron pairs try to take such position which can minimize the rupulsion between them
22370,(iv) the valence shell is taken as a sphere with the electron pairs placed at maximum distance
22371,(v) a multiple bond is treated as if it is a single electron pair and the electron pairs which constitute the bond as single pairs
22372,• valence bond theory valence bond theory was introduced by heitler and london (1927) and developed by pauling and others
22373,it is based on the concept of atomic orbitals and the electronic configuration of the atoms
22374,let us consider the formation of hydrogen molecule based on valence-bond theory
22375,let two hydrogen atoms a and b having their nuclei na  and nb  and electrons present in them are ea and eb
22376,as these two atoms come closer new attractive and repulsive forces begin to operate
22377,(i) the nucleus of one atom is attracted towards its own electron and the electron of the other and vice versa
22378,(ii) repulsive forces arise between the electrons of two atoms and nuclei of two atoms
22379,attractive forces tend to bring the two atoms closer whereas repulsive forces tend to push them apart
22380,"• orbital overlap concept according to orbital overlap concept, covalent bond formed between atoms results in the overlap of orbitals belonging to the atoms having opposite spins of electrons"
22381,formation of hydrogen molecule as a result of overlap of the two atomic orbitals of hydrogen atoms is shown in the figures that follows: stability of a molecular orbital depends upon the extent of the overlap of the atomic orbitals
22382,"• types of orbital overlap depending upon the type of overlapping, the covalent bonds are of two types, known as sigma (σ ) and pi (π) bonds"
22383,(i) sigma (σ bond): sigma bond is formed by the end to end (head-on) overlap of bonding orbitals along the internuclear axis
22384,"the axial overlap involving these orbitals is of three types: • s-s overlapping: in this case, there is overlap of two half-filled s-orbitals along the internuclear axis as shown below: • s-p overlapping: this type of overlapping occurs between half-filled s-orbitals of one atom and half filled p-orbitals of another atoms"
22385,• p-p overlapping: this type of overlapping takes place between half filled p-orbitals of the two approaching atoms
22386,(ii) pi (π bond): π bond is formed by the atomic orbitals when they overlap in such a way that their axes remain parallel to each other and perpendicular to the internuclear axis.the orbital formed is due to lateral overlapping or side wise overlapping
22387,• strength of sigma and pf bonds sigma bond (σ bond) is formed by the axial overlapping of the atomic orbitals while the π-bond is formed by side wise overlapping
22388,"thus, the sigma bond is said to be stronger bond in comparison to a π-bond"
22389,distinction between sigma and n bonds • hybridisation hybridisation is the process of intermixing of the orbitals of slightly different energies so as to redistribute their energies resulting in the formation of new set of orbitals of equivalent energies and shape
22390,salient features of hybridisation: (i) orbitals with almost equal energy take part in the hybridisation
22391,"(ii) number of hybrid orbitals produced is equal to the number of atomic orbitals mixed, (iii) geometry of a covalent molecule can be indicated by the type of hybridisation"
22392,(iv) the hybrid orbitals are more effective in forming stable bonds than the pure atomic orbitals
22393,conditions necessary for hybridisation: (i) orbitals of valence shell take part in the hybridisation
22394,(iii) promotion of electron is not necessary condition prior to hybridisation
22395,(iv) in some cases filled orbitals of valence shell also take part in hybridisation
22396,"types of hybridisation: (i) sp hybridisation: when one s and one p-orbital hybridise to form two equivalent orbitals, the orbital is known as sp hybrid orbital, and the type of hybridisation is called sp hybridisation"
22397,"each of the hybrid orbitals formed has 50% s-characer and 50%, p-character"
22398,"(ii) sp2 hybridisation: in this type, one s and two p-orbitals hybridise to form three equivalent sp2 hybridised orbitals"
22399,all the three hybrid orbitals remain in the same plane making an angle of 120°
22400,"a few compounds in which sp2 hybridisation takes place are bf3, bh3, bcl3 carbon compounds containing double bond etc"
22401,"(iii) sp3 hybridisation: in this type, one s and three p-orbitals in the valence shell of an atom get hybridised to form four equivalent hybrid orbitals"
22402,there is 25% s-character and 75% p-character in each sp3 hybrid orbital
22403,the four sp3 orbitals are directed towards four corners of the tetrahedron
22404,the structures of nh2 and h20 molecules can also be explained with the help of sp3 hybridisation
22405,• formation of molecular orbitals: linear combination of atomic orbitals (lcao) the formation of molecular orbitals can be explained by the linear combination of atomic orbitals
22406,combination takes place either by addition or by subtraction of wave function as shown below
22407,the molecular orbital formed by addition of atomic orbitals is called bonding molecular orbital while molecular orbital formed by subtraction of atomic orbitals is called antibonding molecular orbital
22408,conditions for the combination of atomic orbitals: (1) the combining atomic orbitals must have almost equal energy
22409,(2) the combining atomic orbitals must have same symmetry about the molecular axis
22410,(3) the combining atomic orbitals must overlap to the maximum extent
22411,• types of molecular orbitals sigma (σ) molecular orbitals: they are symmetrical around the bond-axis
22412,"pi (π) molecular orbitals: they are not symmetrical, because of the presence of positive lobes above and negative lobes below the molecular plane"
22413,• electronic configuration and molecular behaviour the distribution of electrons among various molecular orbitals is called electronic configuration of the molecule
22414,• stability of molecules • bond order bond order is defined as half of the difference between the number of electrons present in bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals
22415,"bond order (b.o.) = 1/2 [nb-na] the bond order may be a whole number, a fraction or even zero"
22416,"nature of the bond: integral bond order value for single double and triple bond will be 1, 2 and 3 respectively"
22417,"magnetic nature: if all the molecular orbitals have paired electrons, the substance is diamagnetic"
22418,"if one or more molecular orbitals have unpaired electrons, it is paramagnetic e.g., 02 molecule"
22419,• bonding in some homonuclear (diatomic) molecules (1) hydrogen molecule (h2): it is formed by the combination of two hydrogen atoms
22420,"each hydrogen atom has one electron in is orbital, so, the electronic configuration of hydrogen molecule is this indicates that two hydrogen atoms are bonded by a single covalent bond"
22421,bond dissociation energy of hydrogen has been found = 438 kj/mole
22422,"bond-length = 74 pm no unpaired electron is present therefore,, it is diamagnetic"
22423,"(2) helium molecule (he2): each helium atom contains 2 electrons, thus in he2 molecule there would be 4 electrons"
22424,"thus, partial positive charge develops on hydrogen atom which forms a bond with the other electronegative atom"
22425,this bond is known as hydrogen bond and it is weaker than the covalent bond
22426,"for example, in hf molecule, hydrogen bond exists between hydrogen atom of one molecule and fluorine atom of another molecule"
22427,it can be depicted as • types of h-bonds (i) intermolecular hydrogen bond (ii) intramolecular hydrogen bond
22428,(i) intermolecular hydrogen bond: it is formed between two different molecules of the same or different compounds
22429,"(ii) intramolecular hydrogen bond: in this type, hydrogen atom is in between the two highly electronegative f, n, o atoms present within the same molecule"
22430,"for example, in o-nitrophenol, the hydrogen is in between the two oxygen atoms"
22431,at equilibrium the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of backward reaction
22432,equilibrium mixture: the mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium mixtures
22433,"based on the extent to which the reactions proceed to reach the state of equilibrium, these may be classified in three groups: (i) the reactions which proceed almost to completion and the concentrations of the reactants left are negligible"
22434,"(ii) the reactions in which most of the reactants remains unchanged, i.e"
22435,(iii) the reactions in which the concentrations of both the reactants and products are comparable when the system is in equilibrium
22436,• equilibrium in physical processes (i) solid-liquid equilibrium: the equilibrium is represented as rate of melting of ice = rate of freezing of water
22437,the system here is in dynamic equilibriums and following can be inferred
22438,(a) both the opposing processes occur simultaneously (b) both the processes occur at the same rate so that the amount of ice and water – remains constant
22439,"(ii) liquid-vapour equilibrium the equilibrium can be represented as rate of evaporation = rate of condensation when there is an equilibrium between liquid and vapours, it is called liquid-vapour equilibrium"
22440,(iii) solid-vapour equilibrium this type of equilibrium is attained where solids sublime to vapour phase
22441,"for example, when solid iodine is placed in a closed vessel, violet vapours start appearing in the vessel whose intensity increases with time and ultimately, it becomes constant"
22442,• equilibrium involving dissolution of solid in liquid solution: when a limited amount of salt or sugar or any solute dissolves in a given amount of water solution is formed
22443,at a given temperature state is reached when no more solute can be dissolved then the solution is called saturated solution
22444,the equilibrium between a solid and its solution is indicated by the saturated solution and may be represented as here dissolution and precipitation takes place with the same speed
22445,on adding a small amount of radioactive sugar to the saturated solution it will be found that the sugar present in the solution as well as in the solid state is radioactive
22446,• equilibrium between a gas and its solution in liquid this type of equilibrium can be seen by the following example: let us consider a sealed soda water bottle in which c02 gas is dissolved under high pressure
22447,a state of equilibrium is attained between co2 present in the solution and vapours of the gas
22448,henry’s law: the solubility of a gas in a liquid at a certain temperature is governed by henry’s law
22449,it states that the mass of a gas that dissolves in a given mass of a solvent at any temperature is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the surface of the solvent
22450,• characteristics of equilibria involving physical processes (i) the equilibrium can be attained only in closed systems at a given temperature
22451,(ii) at the equilibrium the measurable properties of the system remain constant
22452,(iii) the equilibrium is dynamic since both the forward and backward processes occur at same rate
22453,"(iv) at equilibrium, the concentrations of substances become constant at constant temperature"
22454,(v) the value of equilibrium constant represents the extent to which the process proceeds before equilibrium is achieved
22455,• equilibrium in chemical processes like equilibria in physical systems it can also be achieved in chemical process involving reversible chemical reactions carried in closed container
22456,the dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium can be demonstrated in the synthesis of ammonia by haber’s process
22457,haber started his experiment with the known amounts of n2 and h2 at high temperature and pressure
22458,at regular intervals of time he determined the amount of ammonia present
22459,after a certain time he found that the composition of mixture remains the same even though some of the reactants are still present
22460,"in general, for a reversible reaction the chemical equilibria can be shown by after a certain time the two reactions occur at the same rate and the system reaches a state of equilibrium"
22461,"• equilibrium in homogeneous system when in a system involving reversible reaction, reactants and products are in the same phase, then the system is called as homogeneous system"
22462,"for example, after some time it can be observed that an equilibrium is formed"
22463,the equilibrium can be seen by constancy in the colour of the reaction mixture
22464,"• law of chemical equilibrium at a constant temperature, the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the molar concentrations of the reactants each raised to a power equal to the corresponding stoichiometric coefficients as represented by the balanced chemical equation"
22465,"let us consider the reaction, • relationship between equilibrium constant k, reaction quotient q and gibbs energy g"
22466,a mathematical expression of thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be described by tine equation
22467,"• factors affecting equilibria le chatelier’s principle: if a system under equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure or concentration, then the equilibrium shifts in such a manner as to reduce or to counteract the effect of change"
22468,"effect of change of concentration: when the concentration of any of the reactants or products in a reaction at equilibrium is changed, the composition of the equilibrium changes so as to minimise the effect"
22469,"effect of pressure change if the number of moles of gaseous reactants and products are equal, there is no effect of pressure"
22470,when the total number of moles of gaseous reactants and total number of moles of gaseous products are different
22471,"on increasing pressure, total number of moles per unit volume increases, thus the equilibrium will shift in direction in which number of moles per unit volume will be less"
22472,"if the total number of moles of products are more than the total number of moles of reactants, low pressure will favour forward reaction"
22473,"if total number of moles of reactants are more than total number of moles of products, high pressure is favourable to forward reaction"
22474,effect of inert gas addition if the volume is kept constant there is no effect on equilibrium after the addition of an inert gas
22475,reason: this is because the addition of an inert gas at constant volume does not change the partial pressure or the molar concentration
22476,the reaction quotient changes only if the added gas is involved in the reaction
22477,"effect of temperature change when the temperature of the system is changed (increased or decreased), the equilibrium shifts in opposite direction in order to neutralize the effect of change"
22478,"in exothermic reaction low temperature favours forward reaction e.g., but practically very low temperature slows down the reaction and thus a catalyst is used"
22479,"in case of endothermic reaction, the increase in temperature will shift the equilibrium in the direction of the endothermic reaction"
22480,effect of a catalyst catalyst has no effect on the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture
22481,reason: since catalyst increases the speed of both the forward and backward reactions to the same extent in a reversible reaction
22482,• ionic equilibrium in solution electrolytes: substances which conduct electricity in their aqueous solution
22483,strong electrolytes: those electrolytes which on dissolution in water are ionized almost completely are called strong electrolytes
22484,weak electrolyte: those electrolytes which on dissolution in water partially dissociated are called weak electrolyte

22488,bases: bases are substances that produce oh–(aq) after dissociation in water
22489,"• limitations of the arrhenius concept (i) according to the arrhenius concept, an acid gives h+ ions in water but the h+ ions does not exist independently because of its very small size (~h-18 m radius) and intense electric field"
22490,"(ii) it does not account for the basicity of substances like, ammonia which does not possess a hydroxyl group"
22491,"• the bronsted-lowry acids and bases according to bronsted-lowry, an acid is a substance which is capable of donating a hydrogen ion h+ and bases are substances capable of accepting a hydrogen ion h+"
22492,"in other words, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors"
22493,• acid and base as conjugate pairs the acid-base pair that differs only by one proton is called a conjugate acid-base pair
22494,let us consider the example of ionization of hcl in water
22495,here water acts as a base because it accepts the proton
22496,cl is a conjugate base of hcl and hcl is the conjugate acid of base cl
22497,"similarly, h20 is conjugate base of an acid h30+ and h30+ is a conjugate acid of base h2o"
22498,"• lewis acids and bases according to lewis, acid is a substance which accepts electron pair and base is a substance with donates an electron pair"
22499,"can act as lewis acids while species like h20, nh3 etc"
22500,"can donate a pair of electrons, can act as lewis bases"
22501,• ionization of acids and bases strength of acid or base is determined with the help of extent of ionization in aqueous solution
22502,ph scale: hydrogen-ion concentration are measured as the number of gram ions of hydrogen ions present per litre of solution
22503,"since these concentrations are usually small, the concentration is generally expressed as the ph of the solution"
22504,ph being the logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion concentration
22505,• di and polybasic acids acids which contain more than one ionizable proton per molecule are called dibasic acids or polybasic acids or polyprotic acids
22506,"factors affecting acid strength when the strength of h-a bond decreases the energy required to break the bond decreases, h-a becomes a stronger acid"
22507,"as the size of a increases down the group, h-a bond strength decreases and so the acid strength increases"
22508,"in a period, as the electronegativity of a increases, the strength of the acid increases"
22509,"• common ion effect if in a aqueous solution of a weak electrolyte, a strong electrolyte is added having an ion common with the weak electrolyte, then the dissociation of the weak electrolyte is decreased or suppressed"
22510,the effect by which the dissociation of weak electrolyte is suppresed is known as common ion effect
22511,• equilibrium: it can be established for both physical and chemical processes
22512,at the state of equilibrium rate of forward and backward reactions are equal
22513,• equilibrium constant: kc is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants each term raised to the stoichiometric coefficients
22514,"for reactions, • le chatelier’s principle: it states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration etc., will cause the equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce the effect of the change"
22515,• electrolytes: substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes
22516,"• arrhenius concept: according to arrhenius, acids give hydrogeneous while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solution"
22517,• bronsted-lowry concept: bronsted-lowry defined acid as proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor
22518,• conjugate base and conjugate acid: when a bronsted-lowry acid reacts with a base it produces its conjugate base and conjugate acid
22519,• conjugate pair of acid and base: conjugate pair of acid and base differs only by one proton
22520,• lewis acids: define acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor
22521,• ph scale: hydronium ion concentration in molarity is more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic scale known as the ph scale
22522,• buffer solution: it is the solution whose ph does not change by addition of small amount of strong acid or base
22523,"• solubility product (ksp): for a sparingly soluble salt, it is defined as the product of molar concentration of the ions raised to the power equal to the number of times each ion occurs in the equation for solubilities"
22524,"• homologous series a homologous series may be defined as a family of organic compounds having the same functional group, similar chemical properties and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by —ch2 units"
22525,the members of a homologous series can be represented by same general molecular formula
22526,"• nomenclature of organic compounds common name (common system): before the iupac system of nomenclature, organic compounds were named after the sources of origin, for example, urea was so named because it was obtained from the urine of mammals"
22527,formic acid was so named since it was extracted from red ants called formica
22528,"• i up ac (international union of pure and applied chemistry) system according to iupac system, the name of an organic compound contains three parts: (i) word root, (ii) suffix, (iii) prefix"
22529,"(i) word root: word root represents the number of carbon atoms present in the principal chain, which is the longest possible chain of carbon atoms"
22530,"(ii) suffix: suffix are of two types, primary suffix, secondary suffix"
22531,(a) primary suffix: it indicates the type of bond in the carbon atoms
22532,(b) secondary suffix: secondary suffix is used to represent the functional group
22533,(iii) prefix: prefix is a part of iupac name which appears before the word root
22534,"prefix are of two types: (a) primary prefix: for example, primary prefix cyclo is used to differentiate cyclic compounds"
22535,(b) secondary prefix: some functional groups are considered as substituents and denoted by secondary prefixes
22536,for example: substituted group            secondary prefix
22537,— f                                           flupro — cl                                         chloro — br                                        bromo — no                                      nitroso — no2                                              nitro — ch3                                    methyl — och3                                methoxy naming of compounds containing functional groups: the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group is numbered in such a manner that the functional group is attached at the carbon atoms possessing lowest possible number in the chain
22538,"in case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional group is selected as principal functional group and the compound is named on that basis"
22539,the choice of principal functional group is made on the basis of order of preference
22540,"the order of decreasing priority for the functional group is • isomerism when there are two or more compounds possessing the same molecular formula but different structural formula and different physical and chemical properties, the phenomenon is called isomerism"
22541,it is of two types: (1) structural isomerism (2) stereoisomerism (1) structural isomerism: structural isomerism is shown by compounds having the same molecular formula but different structural formulae differing in the arrangement of atoms
22542,"(2) stereoisomerism: when isomerism is caused by the different arrangements of atoms or groups in space, the phenomenon is called stereoisomerism"
22543,the steroeoisomers have same structural formula but differ in arrangement of atoms in space
22544,stereoisomerism is of two types: (i) geometrical or cis-trans isomerism (ii) optical isomerism • fundamental concepts in organic reaction mechanism fission of a covalent bond: a covalent bond can undergo fission in two ways: (i) by homolytic fission or homolysis (ii) by heterolytic fission or heterolysis homolytic fission: in this process each of the atoms acquires one of the bonding electrons
22545,heterolytic fission: in this process one of atoms aquires both of the bonding electrons when the bond is broken
22546,if b is more electronegative than a which thereby aquires both the bonding electrons and becomes negatively charged
22547,reaction intermediates: heterolytic and homolytic bond fission results in the formation of short-lived fragments called reaction intermediates
22548,"among the important reaction intermediates are carbonium ions, carbanions, carbon free radicals and carbenes"
22549,carbonium ions (carbocations): organic ions which contain a positively charged carbon atom are called carbonium ions or carbocations
22550,"tertiary carbonium ion is more stable than a secondary, which in turn is more stable than a primary because of +1 effect associated with alkyl group"
22551,carbanion: organic ion which contains a negatively charged carbon atom are called carbanions
22552,"a primary carbanion is more stable than a secondary, which in turn is more stable than a tertiary, because of +1 effect associated with alkyl group"
22553,"electrophile: it is positively charged or neutral species which is electron deficient, e.g., he–, h20+, ch3 , nh4+, aicl3 , s03 , chcl2 , cci3"
22554,"nucleophile: it is negatively charged or neutral species with lone pair of electrons e.g., (ho–), cyanide (c = n), h20: r3n, r2nh etc"
22555,electron displacement effects in covalent bonds: electronic displacements in covalent bonds occurs due to the presence of an atom or group of different electronegativity or under the influence of some outside attaching group
22556,these lead to a number of effects which are as follows: (i) inductive effect (ii) elecromeric effect (iii) resonance or mesomeric effect (iv) hyperconjugation effect
22557,the a electrons which form a covalent bond are seldom shared equally between the two atoms
22558,due to different electronegatively electrons are displaced towards the more electronegative atom
22559,"consider the carbon-chlorine bond as chlorine is more electronegative, it will become negatively charged with respect to the carbon atom"
22560,structure ii- indicates the direction in which the electrons are drawn
22561,atoms or groups which lose electrons towards a carbon atom are said to have a +1 effect
22562,those atoms or groups which draw electrons away from a carbon atom are said to have a -i effect
22563,some common atoms or groups which cause +i or -i effects are shown below: the inductive effect of c3 upon c2 is significantly less than the effect of the chlorine atom on c
22564,resonance structure: a number of organic compounds cannot be accurately represented by one structure
22565,"for example, benzene is ordinarily represented as carbon-carbon double bond length = 1.34 a carbon-carbon single bond length = 1.54a"
22566,but it has been determined experimentally that all carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are identical and have same bond length (1.39a)
22567,thus the structure of benzene cannot be represented by single structure
22568,it can be represented equally well by ‘he energetically similar structures i and ii
22569,actual structure of benzene is resonance hybrid of structures i and ii
22570,another example of resonance is provided by nitromethane (ch3n02) which can be represented by two lewis structures
22571,the actual structure of nitromethane is a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms i and ii
22572,resonance energy: the difference in the energy between the most stable contributing structure for a compound and its resonance hybrid is called as resonance energy or resonance stabilisation energy
22573,resonance effect: the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two π-bonds or between a π-bond and a lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom
22574,there are two types of resonance or mesomeric effects designated as r or m effect

22809,"when liquid flows, the layer immediately below it tries to retard its flow while the one above tries to accelerate"
22810,"effect of temp, on viscosity: viscosity of liquids decreases as the temperature rises because at high temperature, molecules have high kinetic energy and can overcome the intermolecular forces to slip past one another"

22832,• fractional oxidation numbers elements as such do not have any fractional oxidation numbers
22833,"when the same element are involved in different bonding in a species, their actual oxidation states are whole numbers but an average of these is fractional"
22834,of a particular element can be claculated only if we know about the structure of the compound or in which it is present

22861,• ionization enthalpy the ionization enthalpies of the alkali metals are generally low and decrease down the group from li to cs
22862,reason: since alkali metals possess large atomic sizes as a result of which the valence s-electron (ns1) can be easly removed

23056,first three members of this class can be represented as structure: in methane carbon forms single bonds with four hydrogen atoms
23057,c—c and c—h bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of sp3 hybrid orbitals of carbon and is orbitals of hydrogen atoms
23058,• nomenclature guidelines use the following step-by-step procedure to write the iupac names from the structural formulas
23059,"identify the longest chain: in the given example, longest chain has seven carbons"
23060,number the chain: the chain is numbered from left to right
23061,"identify the alkyl group: there are two methyl groups at c-2 and c-3, there is one ethyl group of c-4"
23062,"write the iupac name: in this case the iupac name is 4-ethyl-2,3-dimethyl heptane"
23063,always keep in mind (a) numbers are separated from each other by commas
23064,"(b) numbers are separated from names by hyphens, (c) prefixes di, tri are not taken into account in alphabetising substituent names"
23065,"• newman projections in this projection, the molecule is viewed at the c—c bond head on"
23066,"• relative stability of conformations in staggered form of ethane there are maximum repulsive forces, minimum energy and maximum stability of molecule"
23067,"on the other hand, when the staggered form changes in the eclipsed form the electron clouds of the carbon hydrogen bonds come closer to each other resulting in increase in electron cloud repulsions, molecule have to possess more energy and thus has lower stability"
23068,torsional angle: magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about c—c bond
23069,• alkenes alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain a carbon-carbon double bond (c=c) in their molecule
23070,they have the general formula structure: let us consider (h2c=ch2) for illustrating the orbital make up of alkenes
23071,in ethylene the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized- they are attached to each other by a a bond and a σ bond
23072,the a bond results from the overlap of two sp2 hybrid orbitals
23073,the π bond is formed from overlap of the unhybridized p-orbitals
23074,ppints to be noted (i) the carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes is made up of one σ and one π-bond
23075,• nomenclature in iupac system (i) the name of the hydrocarbon is based on the parent alkene having the longest ‘ carbon chain of which double bond is apart
23076,"(ii) this chain is numbered from the end near the double bond and its position is indicated by the number of the carbon atom not which the double bond originates, (iii) the name of the parent alkene with the position number of the double bond is written first and then the names of other substituents prefixed to it"
23077,"(iv) when there are two or three double bonds in a molecule, the ending-one of the corresponding alkane is replaced by-a diene to get the name"
23078,"• isomerism structural isomerism: ethene and propene have no structural isomers, but there are three structures of butenes"
23079,"of these, two are straight chain structures with the difference being in the position of double bond in the molecules"
23080,these are position isomers and third structure is a branched-chain isomer
23081,geometrical isomerism: it is known that a carbon-carbon double bond is made up of one σ bond and one π-bond
23082,this presentation of rotation about the carbon-carbon double bond gives rise to the phenomenon of geometrical isomerism
23083,"an alkene having a formula rch=chr can have two stereoisomers, depending upon whether the two alkyl groups are on the same or opposite sides of the double bond"
23084,"if they are on the same side, then it is called cis-isomer"
23085,"if they are on opposite sides, then it is called trans-isomer"
23086,"due to different arrangement of atoms or groups in space, these isomers differ in their properties like melting point, boiling point, dipole moment, solubility, etc"
23087,• alkynes alkynes are characterised by the presence of a triple bond in the molecule
23088,"the first and the most important member of this series of hydrocarbons is acetylene, hc=ch, and hence they are also called the acetylenes"
23089,structure: let us consider ethyne (hc=ch) for illustrating the orbital make up of ethyne
23090,they are attached to each other by a σ-bond and two π-bonds
23091,the σ -bond results from the overlap of two sp hybrid orbitals
23092,the π bonds are formed from the separate overlap of the two p-orbitals from the two adjacent carbon atoms
23093,the other sp hybrid orbital of each carbon atom forms a σ bond with another carbon or hydrogen atom
23094,points to be noted: (i) the carbon-carbon triple bond in alkynes is made up of one σ and two π bonds
23095,these reactions are due to the availability of more exposed π electrons
23096,• nomenclature iupac system: the iupac names of alkynes are obtained by dropping the ending-ane of the parent alkane and adding the suffix-yne
23097,carbon chain including the triple bond is – numbered from the end nearest this bond
23098,the position of the triple bond is indicated by prefixing the number of carbon preceding it to the name of the alkyne
23099,preparation: from calcium carbide: ethyne is prepared by treating calcium carbide with water
23100,"calcium carbide is prepared as follows: from vicinal dihalides: when reacted with vicinal dihalides, alcoholic potassium hydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation"
23101,one molecule of hydrogen halide is eliminated to form alkenyl halide which on treatment with sodamide gives alkyne
23102,aromatic compounds containing benzene ring are known as benzenoids and those not containing a benzene ring are known as non-benzenoids
23103,nomenclature and isomerism: benzene and its homologous are generally called by their common names which are accepted by the iupac system
23104,the homologous of benzene having a single alkyl group are named as alkyl benzenes
23105,"structure of benzene: by elemental analysis, it is found that molecular formula of benzene is c6h6"
23106,"in 1865, kekule gave the cyclic planar structure of benzene with six carbons with alternate double and single bonds"
23107,"in one of the isomers, the bromine atoms are attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the other they are attached to the singly bonded carbon"
23108,to overcome this problem kekule suggested that benzene was a mixture of two forms
23109,failure of kekule’s structure: kekule structure of benzene failed to explain the unique stability and its preference to substitution reaction than addition reactions
23110,resonance structure of benzene: the phenomenon in which two or more structures can be written for a substance which involve identical positions of atoms is called resonance
23111,in benzene’s kekule’s structures (1) and (2) represent the resonance structures
23112,actual structure – of the molecule is represented by hybrid of the these two structures
23113,orbital structure of benzene: all six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 hybridized
23114,the sp2 hybrid orbitals overlap with each other and with s orbitals of the six hydrogen atoms forming c—c and c—h σ-bonds
23115,the data indicates that all the six c—c bond length are of the same order (139 pm) which is intermediate between (c—c) single bond (154 pm) and c—c double bond (133 pm)
23116,thus the presence of pure double bond in benzene gives the idea of reductance of benzene to show addition reaction under normal condition
23117,aromaticity: it is a property of the sp2 hybridized planar rings in which the p orbitals allow cyclic delocalization of π electrons
23118,conditions for aromaticity: (i) an aromatic compound is cyclic and planar
23119,(ii) each atom in an aromatic ring has a p orbital
23120,these p orbitals must be parallel so that a continuous overlap is possible around the ring
23121,(iii) the cyclic π molecular orbital (electron cloud) formed by overlap of p orbitals must contain (4n + 2) π electrons
23122,"however, there are some synthetic methods which is applied in the laboratory for the preparation of benzene"
23123,"(iii) benzene itself is a good solvent for many organic and inorganic substances e.g., fat, resins, sulphur and iodine"
23124,"(iv) it bums with a luminous, sooty flame in contrast to alkanes and alkenes which usually bum with a bluish flame"
23125,the electrophile attacks the aromatic ring to form a carbonium ion
23126,activating groups: these group activates the benzene ring for the attack by an electrophile
23127,"deactivating groups: due to deactivating group because of strong —i effect, overall electron density on benzene ring decreases"
23128,metadirecting group: the groups which direct the incoming group to meta position are called meta directing groups
23129,"some examples of meta directing groups are —n02, —cn, —cho, —cor, —cooh, —coor, -s03h etc"
23130,let us consider the example of nitro group: since nitro group due to its strong -i effect reduces the electron density in benzene ring
23131,carcinogenicity and toxicity: some polynuclear hydrocarbons containing more than two benzene rings fused together become toxic and they are having cancer producing property
23132,"they are actually formed due to incomplete combustion of some organic materials like tobacco, coal and petroleum, etc"
23133,open chain saturated compound—alkane unsaturated compound—alkenes and alkynes aromatic compound—benzene and its derivatives terminal alkynes are weakly acidic in nature
23134,• eclipsed conformation: less stable because of more repulsion between bond pairs of electrons
23135,• staggered: it is more stable since there is less repulsion between bond pairs of electrons
23136,• geometrical isomerism: observed only in compounds containing a double bond
23137,aromaticity is determined by huckle’s rule (4n + 2) rule class 11 chemistry notes
23138,• group 13 elements: the boron family outer electronic configuration: ns2np1 atomic radii: the atomic and ionic radii of group 13 elements are smaller than the corresponding elements of alkali and alkaline earth metals
23139,reason: on moving from left to right in a period the effective nuclear charge increases and the outer electrons are pulled more strongly towards the nucleus
23140,"on moving down the group, both atomic and ionic radii expected to increase due to the addition of a new electron shell with each succeeding element"
23141,exception: atomic radius of ga is less than that of al due to the presence of poor shedding 10d-electrons in gallium
23142,ionisation enthalpies: first ionisation enthalpies of the elements of group-13 are less than those of the elements present in group-2 in the same period
23143,"reason: the removal of p-electron is much easier than the s-electron and therefore, the first ionisation enthalpies (∆i h1) of the elements of group 13 are lower as compared to the corresponding elements of group 2"
23144,on moving down the group 13 from b to al the first-ionization enthalpies (∆i h1) decrease due to an increase in atomic size and screening effect which outweigh the effect of increased nuclear charge
23145,there is discontinuity expected in the ionisation enthalpy values between al and ga and between in and tl due to enability of d- and f-electrons which have low screening effect to compensate the increase in nuclear charge
23146,"electronegativity: down the group, electronegativity first decreases from b to al and then increases"
23147,this is due to discrepancies in the atomic size of the elements
23148,physical properties (i) due to strong crystalline lattice boron has high melting point
23149,rest of the members of this family have low melting point
23150,(ii) boron is extremely hard and black coloured solid and non metallic in nature
23151,(iii) other members of this family are soft metals with low melting point and high electrical conductivity
23152,"chemical properties oxidation states: the first two elements boron and aluminium show only +3 oxidation state ~ in the compounds but the other elements of this group gallium, indium and thalium also exhibit +1 oxidation state in addition to +3 oxidation state i.e., they show variable oxidation states"
23153,"as we move down the group, the stability of +3 oxidation state decreases while that of +1 oxidation state progressively increases"
23154,• some compounds of boron physical properties of boric acid: (i) it is a white crystalline solid
23155,(iii) it is sparingly soluble in cold water but fairly soluble in hot water
23156,"structure of boric acid (iii) diborane, (b2h6): the series of compounds of boron with hydrogen is known as boranes"
23157,diborane is prepared by the reduction of boron trifluoride with lialh4 in diethyl ether
23158,4bf3 + 3lialh4 ——–> 2b2h6+ 3lif + 3alf3 laboratory method of preparation
23159,in laboratory diborane is prepared by the oxidation of sodium borohydride with iodine
23160,2nabh4 + i2 ——-> b2h6 + 2nai +h2 industrial method of preparation
23161,"on industrial scale, diborane is prepared by reduction of bf3 with sodium hydride"
23162,"physical properties: (i) diborane is a colourless, highly toxic gas with a b.p"
23163,chemical properties: (i) boranes are readily hydrolysed by water to form boric acid b2h6(g) + 6h20(z) ——> 2b(oh)3(aq) + 6h2(g) (ii) it burns in oxygen evolving an enormous amount of heat b2h6 + 302 —–> b203 + 3h20 (iii) reaction with lewis base: diborane on treatment with lewis bases undergo cleavage reactions to form borane which then reacts with lewis bases to form adducts
23164,"nme3 b2h6 + 2co ———> 2bh3 .co • group 14 elements: the carbon family group 14 includes carbon (c), silicon (si), germanium (ge), tin (sn) and lead (pb)"
23165,carbon: carbon is the seventeenth most abundant element by weight in the earth’s crust
23166,"in combined state it is present in metal carbonates, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide gas (0.03%) in air"
23167,(ii) naturally occurring carbon contains two stable iosotopes 12c and 13c and third isotope 14c
23168,14c is a radioactive isotope with half life 5770 years and is used for radiocarbon dating
23169,covalent radius: covalent radius expected to increase from c to si
23170,reason: due to the addition of a new energy shell in each succeeding element
23171,the increase in covalent radii from si to pb is small due to ineffective shielding of the valence electrons by the intervening d- and f orbitals
23172,ionization enthalpy: the first ionization enthalpies of group 14 elements are higher than those of the corresponding group 13 elements
23173,reason: because effective nuclear charge increases and size of the atoms becomes smaller
23174,first ionization enthalpy decreases on moving down the group from carbon to tin
23175,the decrease is very sharp from carbon to silicon while there is slight increase in the first ionization enthalpy of lead as compared to that of tin
23176,electronegativity: group 14 elements are smaller in size as compared to group 13 elements that’s why this group are slightly more electronegative than group 13
23177,small increase in ionization enthalpy from sn to pb is due to the effect of increased nuclear charge outweighs the shielding effect due to the presence of additional 4f- and 5d-electrons
23178,physical properties: (i) all the elements of group 14 elements are solids
23179,germanium forms stable compounds in +4 state and only few compounds in +2 state
23180,lead forms compounds in +2 state are stable and in +4 state are strong oxidising agents
23181,"• anomalous behaviour of carbon carbon, differs from the rest of the member of its family"
23182,the main reason for the anomalous behaviour is: (i) exceptionally small atomic and ionic size (ii) higher ionization enthalpy (iii) absence of d-orbitals in the valence shell
23183,it can be explained as follows: => since carbon has only s and p-orbitals it can accommodate only four pairs of electrons ; other member can expand their covalence due to the presence of d-orbitals
23184,=> carbon can form pπ-pπ multiple bonds with itself and other atoms having small size and high electronegativity
23185,heavier elements do not form pπ-pπ bonds because their atomic orbitals are too large and diffuse to have effective overlapping
23186,=> carbon atoms have the tendency to link with one another through covalent bonds to form chains and rings
23187,• allotropes of carbon the property of an element to exist in two or more forms which have different physical properties but identical chemical properties is called allotropy and different forms are called allotropes
23188,"carbon exists in two allotropic forms: (i) crystalline (ii) amorphous crystalline form of carbon: diamond, graphite, fullerenes diamond: in diamond each carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridisation"
23189,(ii) it is used as an abrasive for sharpening hard tools in making dyes and in manufacture of tungsten filaments
23190,graphite has a two-dimensional sheet like structure consisting of a number of hexagonal rings fused together
23191,layers are held by van der waals forces and distance between two layers is 340 pm
23192,"(iii) used as a dry lubricant in machines running at high temperature, where oil cannot be used as a lubricant"
23193,preparation: fullerenes is prepared by heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gas such as helium or argon
23194,the sooty material formed by the condensation of vapourised cn small molecules consists of mainly with smaller quantity of c70 and traces of other fullerenes consisting of even number of carbon atoms up to 350 or above
23195,c60 molecule has a shape like soccer ball and called buckminsterfullerenes
23196,six-membered rings are fused to both the other six-membered rings and five-membered rings but the five-membered rings are connected only to six-membered rings
23197,amorphous allotropic forms of carbon coke: it is a greyish black hard solid and is obtained by destructive distillation
23198,wood charcoal: it is obtained by strong heating of wood in a limited supply of air
23199,animal charcoal: it is obtained by the destructive distillation of bones
23200,"uses of carbon: (i) graphite fibre are used for making superior sports goods such as tennis and badminton rackets, fishing rods"
23201,(ii) being good conductor graphite is used for making electrodes for batteries and industrial electrolysis
23202,"(iii) being highly porous, activated charcoal is used for absorbing poisonous gases in gas masks"
23203,(iv) carbon black is used as black pigment in black ink and as filler in automibile tyres
23204,• some important compounds of carbon and silicon carbon monoxide preparation: it is prepared by direct oxidation of c in limited supply of oxygen
23205,(iii) it is powerful reducing agent and reduces almost all metal oxides except alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides
23206,(iv) in co molecule there are one σ (sigma) and two π bonds between carbon and oxygen
23207,: c = o : (v) it is highly porous in nature
23208,it forms a complex with haemoglobin which is about 300 times more stable than the oxygen-haemoglobin complex
23209,"this prevents haemoglobin in the red blood corpuscles from carrying oxygen round the body, there by causing suffocation ultimately leading to death"
23210,carbon dioxide preparation: it is prepared by complete combustion of carbon and carbon containing fuels in properties: (i) it is a colourless and odourless gas
23211,when c02 dissolves in water only some of the molecules react with water to form carbonic acid
23212,but increase in combustion of fossil fuels and decomposition of limestone for cement manufacture increase of c02 in the atomosphere is one of the main reasons of green house effect
23213,"silicon dioxide (si02) silicon dioxide, commonly known as silica, occurs in various crystallographic forms"
23214,"for example, quartz, cristobalite and thermite are some of the crystalline forms of silica"
23215,each silicon atom is covalently bonded in a tetrahedral manner to four oxygen atoms
23216,each oxygen atom in turn covalently bonded to another silicon atoms as shown below: properties: (i) in normal form silica is very less reactive
23217,"(ii) at elevated temperature it does not reacts with halogens, dihydrogen and most of the acids and metals"
23218,si02 + 2naoh —–> na2si03 + h2o si02+ 4hf ——–> sif4+ 2h20 uses: (i) quartz is extensively used as a piezoelectric material
23219,"(iii) an amorphous form of silica, kieselghur is used in filtration plants"
23220,• general configuration: ns2np1-6 – boron is a typical non-metal and the other members are metals
23221,– borax is a white crystalline solide formula is na2 [b4o5(oh)4]
23222,"– allotropy: the important allotropes of carbon are diamond, graphite, and fullerenes"
23223,– the members of carbon family exhibit +4 and +2 oxidation state
23224,the tendency to show +2 oxidation state increases among heavier elements
23225,– lead in +2 state is stable whereas in +4 oxidation state it is a strong oxidising agent
23226,– carbon monoxide is neutral whereas c02 is acidic in nature
23227,– carbon monoxide having lone pair of electrons on c forms metal carbonyls
23228,– carbon monoxide forms a haemoglobin complex which is deadly poisonous due to its higher stability

23317,"2mg(s) + o2(g) \(\underrightarrow { \triangle }\) 2mgo(s) before burning in air, the magnesium ribbon is cleaned by rubbing with sandpaper"
23318,this is done to remove the protective layer of basic magnesium carbonate from the surface of the magnesium ribbon
23319,reactant: substances which take part in a chemical reaction are called reactants
23320,product: new substance formed after a chemical reaction is called a product
23321,characteristics of chemical reactions : (i) evolution of gas: the chemical reaction between zinc and dilute sulphuric acid is characterised by the evolution of hydrogen gas
23322,zn(s) + h2so4(aq) → znso4(aq) + h2(g) ↑ (ii) change in colour: the chemical reaction between citric acid and purple coloured potassium permanganate solution is characterised by a change in colour from purple to colourless

23329,bacl2(aq) + h2so4(aq) → baso4(s) (ppt) + 2hcl(aq) what is a chemical equation class 10
23330,chemical equation: representation of chemical reaction using symbols and formulae of the substances is called chemical equation
23331,"example: a + b → c + d in this equation, a and b are called reactants and c and d are called the products"
23332,"this reaction can be represented by the following chemical equation: hydrogen + oxygen → water h2 + o2 → h2o in the first equation, words are used and in second, symbols of substances are used to write the chemical equation"
23333,"for convenience, the symbol of substance is used to represent chemical equations"
23334,a chemical equation is a way to represent the chemical reaction in a concise and informative way
23335,a chemical equation can be divided into two types: balanced chemical equation and unbalanced chemical equation
23336,(a) balanced chemical equation: a balanced chemical equation has the number of atoms of each element equal on both sides
23337,"example: zn + h2so4 → znso4 + h2 in this equation, numbers of zinc, hydrogen and sulphate are equal on both sides, so it is a balanced chemical equation"
23338,"according to the law of conservation of mass, mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction"
23339,"to obey this law, the total mass of elements present in reactants must be equal to the total mass of elements present in products"
23340,"(b) unbalanced chemical equation: if the number of atoms of each element in reactants is not equal to the number of atoms of each element present in the product, then the chemical equation is called unbalanced chemical equation"
23341,"example: fe + h2o → fe3o4 + h2 in this example, a number of atoms of elements are not equal on two sides of the reaction"
23342,"for example; on the left-hand side only one iron atom is present, while three iron atoms are present on the right-hand side"
23343,"balancing a chemical equation: to balance the given or any chemical equation, follow these steps: fe + h2o → fe3o4 + h2 write the number of atoms of elements present in reactants and in products in a table as shown here"
23344,"in this equation, the number of oxygen atom is the maximum on the rhs"
23345,"to balance the oxygen, one needs to multiply the oxygen on the lhs by 4, so that, the number of oxygen atoms becomes equal on both sides"
23346,"fe + 4 × h2o → fe3o4 + h2 now, the number of hydrogen atoms becomes 8 on the lhs, which is more than that on the rhs"
23347,"to balance it, one needs to multiply the hydrogen on the rhs by 4"
23348,"fe + 4 × h2o → fe3o4 + 4 × h2 after that, the number of oxygen and hydrogen atoms becomes equal on both sides"
23349,"the number of iron is one on the lhs, while it is three on the rhs"
23350,"to balance it, multiply the iron on the lhs by 3"
23351,3 × fe + 4 × h2o → fe3o4 + 4 × h2 now the number of atoms of each element becomes equal on both sides
23352,"to make equations more informative: writing the symbols of physical states of substances in a chemical equation: by writing the physical states of substances, a chemical equation becomes more informative"
23353,writing the condition in which reaction takes place: the condition is generally written above and/or below the arrow of a chemical equation

23367,it happens because silver chloride is colourless while silver is a grey metal
23368,(iii) displacement reaction: the chemical reactions in which a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from a compound is known as displacement reactions
23369,displacement reactions are also known as substitution reaction or single displacement/ replacement reactions
23370,a general displacement reaction can be represented by using a chemical equation as follows : a + bc → ac + b displacement reaction takes place only when ‘a’ is more reactive than b
23371,"if ‘b’ is more reactive than ‘a’, then ‘a’ will not displace ‘c’ from ‘bc’ and reaction will not be taking place"

23389,"when copper oxide is heated with hydrogen, then copper metal and hydrogen are formed"
23390,"cuo + h2 → cu + h2o (i) in this reaction, cuo is changing into cu"
23391,"removal of oxygen from a substance is called reduction, so copper oxide is being reduced to copper"
23392,"addition of oxygen to a substance is called oxidation, so hydrogen is being oxidised to water"
23393,(vi) exothermic and endothermic reactions: exothermic reaction: reaction which produces energy is called exothermic reaction

23399,"corrosion (rusting) weakens the iron and steel objects and structures such as railings, car bodies, bridges and ships etc"
23400,"corrosion of copper: copper objects lose their lustre and shine after some time because the surface of these objects acquires a green coating of basic copper carbonate, cuco3.cu(oh)2 when exposed to air"
23401,"corrosion of silver metal: the surface of silver metal gets tarnished (becomes dull) on exposure to air, due to the formation of a coating of black silver sulphide(ag2s) on its surface by the action of h2s gas present in the air"
23402,rancidity: the taste and odour of food materials containing fat and oil changes when they are left exposed to air for a long time

23421,"example: sulphuric acid (h2so4), acetic acid (ch3cooh), nitric acid (hno3) etc"
23422,"types of acids: acids are divided into two types on the basis of their occurrence i.e., natural acids and mineral acids"
23423,(i) natural acids: acids which are obtained from natural sources are called natural acids or organic acids
23424,examples: methanoic acid (hcooh) acetic acid (ch3cooh) oxalic acid (c2h2o4) etc
23425,example: hydrochloric acid (hcl) sulphuric acid (h2so4) nitric acid (hno3) carbonic acid (h2co3) phosphoric acid (h3po4) etc
23426,chemical properties of acid: (i) reaction of acids with metal: acids give hydrogen gas along with respective salt when they react with a metal
23427,metal + acid → salt + hydrogen examples: hydrogen gas and zinc chloride are formed when hydrochloric acid reacts with zinc metal
23428,hydrogen gas and sodium sulphate are formed when sulphuric acid reacts with sodium metal
23429,test for hydrogen gas: the gas evolved after reaction of acid with metal can be tested by bringing a lighted candle near it
23430,"if the gas bums with a pop sound, then it confirms the evolution of hydrogen gas"
23431,burning with pop sound is the characteristic test for hydrogen gas
23432,(ii) reaction of acids with metal carbonate: acids give carbon dioxide gas and respective salts along with water when they react with metal carbonates
23433,"metal carbonate + acid → salt + carbon dioxide + water examples: hydrochloric acid gives carbon dioxide gas, sodium chloride along with water when reacts with sodium carbonate"
23434,"sulphuric acid gives calcium sulphate, carbon dioxide gas, calcium sulphate and water when it reacts with calcium carbonate nitric acid gives sodium nitrate, water and carbon dioxide gas when it reacts with sodium carbonate"
23435,"(iii) reaction of acid with hydrogen carbonates (bicarbonates): acids give carbon dioxide gas, respective salt and water when they react with metal hydrogen carbonate"
23436,"acid + metal hydrogen carbonate → salt + carbon dioxide + water example: sulphuric acid gives sodium sulphate, carbon dioxide gas and water when it reacts with sodium bicarbonate"
23437,test for evolution of carbon dioxide gas: carbon dioxide turns lime water milky when passed through it
23438,the gas evolved because of reaction of the acid with metal carbonate or metal hydrogen carbonate turns lime water milky
23439,this happens because of the formation of a white precipitate of calcium carbonate
23440,"but when excess of carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, it makes milky colour of lime water disappear"
23441,"as calcium hydrogen carbonate is soluble in water, thus, the milky colour of solution mixture disappears"
23442,common in acids: acids give hydrogen gas when they react with metal
23443,"for example; hydrochloric acid (hcl), sulphuric acid (h2so4), nitric acid (hno3), etc"
23444,the dissociation of hydrogen ion in aqueous solution is the common property in all acids
23445,"because of the dissociation of hydrogen ion in aqueous solution, an acid shows acidic behaviour"
23446,examples: hydrochloric acid (hcl) gives hydrogen ion (h+) and chloride ion (cl–) when it is dissolved in water
23447,acetic acid (ch3cooh) gives acetate ion (ch3coo–) and hydrogen ion (h+)
23448,acids strong acids an acid which is completely ionised in water and produces (h+) is called strong acid
23449,"examples: hydrochloric acid (hcl), sulphuric acid (h2so4), nitric acid (hno3) weak acids an acid which is partially ionised in water and thus produces a small amount of hydrogen ions (h+) is called a weak acid"
23450,"example: acetic acid (ch3cooh), carbonic acid (h2co3) when a concentrated solution of acid is diluted by mixing water, then the concentration of hydrogen ions (h+) or hydronium ion (h3o–) per unit volume decreases"
23451,"bases: bases are bitter in taste, have soapy touch, turn red litmus blue and give hydroxide ions (oh–) in aqueous solution"
23452,examples: sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) – naoh calcium hydroxide – ca(oh)2 potassium hydroxide (caustic potash) – (koh) properties of bases: have a bitter taste
23453,release oh– ions in aqueous solution types of bases: bases can be divided in two types – water soluble and water-insoluble
23454,the hydroxide of alkali and alkaline earth metals are soluble in water
23455,"chemical properties of bases: (i) reaction of base with metals: when alkali (base) reacts with metal, it produces salt and hydrogen gas"
23456,alkali + metal → salt + hydrogen examples: sodium hydroxide gives hydrogen gas and sodium zincate when reacts with zinc metal
23457,sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas are formed when sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium metal
23458,(ii) reaction of base with oxides of non-metals: non-metal oxides are acidic in nature
23459,when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water it produces carbonic acid
23460,"therefore, when a base reacts with non-metal oxide, both neutralize each other resulting respective salt and water"
23461,base + non-metal oxide → salt + water (non-metal oxides are acidic in nature) examples: sodium hydroxide gives sodium carbonate and water when it reacts with carbon dioxide
23462,calcium hydroxide gives calcium carbonate and water when it reacts with carbon dioxide
23463,(iii) neutralisation reaction: an acid neutralizes a base when they react with each other and respective salt and water are formed
23464,"acid + base → salt + water since, the reaction between acid and base both neutralize each other, hence, it is also known as neutralization reaction"
23465,examples: sodium chloride and water are formed when hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide (a strong base)
23466,"in a similar way, calcium chloride is formed along with water when hydrochloric acid reacts with calcium hydroxide (a base)"
23467,(iv) reaction of acid with metal oxides: metal oxides are basic in nature
23468,"thus, when an acid reacts with a metal oxide both neutralize each other"
23469,"acid + metal oxide → salt + water (metal oxides are basic in nature) examples: calcium is a metal, thus, calcium oxide is a metallic oxide which is basic in nature"

23473,"example: when sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water, it dissociates hydroxide ion and sodium ion"
23474,"similarly, when potassium hydroxide is dissolved in water, it dissociates hydroxide ion and potassium ion"

23717,cellular dna is the information source for making proteins in the cell
23718,a part of dna that provides information for one particular protein is called a gene for that protein for example; the height of a plant depends upon the growth hormone which is in turn controlled by the gene

23725,"each gene set is present, not as a single long thread of dna, but as separate independent pieces each called a chromosome"
23726,"each cell gets two copies of the chromosome, one from each parent"
23727,each germ cell or gamete has one copy of it because there is reductional division in the sex organs at the time of formation of gametes
23728,when fertilization takes place normal number of chromosomes is restored in the progeny ensuring the stability of dna of the species
23729,it is the process by which sex of a newborn can be determined
23730,different species use different strategies for this : in some animals the temperature at which fertilized eggs are kept determines whether the developing animals will be males or females
23731,some animals like snails can change sex indicating that sex is not genetically determined
23732,in human beings sex of the individual is determined genetically; means genes inherited from the parents decide the sex of the offspring
23733,"sex determination in human beings: in human beings, all chromosomes are not paired"
23734,22 chromosomes are paired but one pair called sex chromosome is odd in not having a perfect pair in males
23735,on the other hand males have a normal sized x but the other is short called y so it is shown as xy
23736,all gametes or ova formed by the homogenetic female are similar i.e
23737,half with x chromosome and the other half with y chromosome
23738,there are two possibilities : autosomes: those chromosomes which do not play any role in sex determination
23739,sex chromosomes: those chromosomes which play a role in determining sex of the newborn
23740,if the sperm having x chromosome fertilizes with ovum with x chromosome then the baby will have xx chromosome and it will be female
23741,if the sperm having y chromosome fertilizes with ovum with x chromosome then the baby will have xy chromosomes and it will be male
23742,"evolution: acquired and inherited traits, speciation, evolution and classification, evolution by stages, human evolution"
23743,"evolution: it is the sequence, of gradual, irreversible changes which took place in the primitive organisms over millions of years to form new present-day species"
23744,variations that resulted in formation of new species occurred basically due to errors in dna copying as well as due to sexual reproduction
23745,an illustration to show variations in a population: a group of twelve red beetles live in green bushes and reproduce sexually so are likely to develop variations
23746,"there are the following possibilities first situation: crows eat these beetles as they can easily pick up red ones in the green bushes there is a colour variation during sexual reproduction and green beetles appears, it reproduces and its population increases"
23747,crows are not able to see green beetles so their population continues to increase but that of red beetles decreases
23748,second situation: due to a colour variation few blue beetle appear forming blue population
23749,initially there are more of red beetles and less of blue
23750,"there is sudden calamity, an elephant kills red beetles by stamping on bush, blue beetles survive reproduce and increase in number"
23751,in this case there is no survival advantage but provides diversity without any adaptation
23752,"third situation: as the population of beetles increases, the bushes suffer from a disease and the availability of food for beetles decreases"
23753,the size of beetles decrease but after a few years as the plant disease is eliminated and enough food is available for the beetles they come back to their normal size
23754,acquired traits: acquired traits are those which are not inherited over generations as they are caused due to change in the non-reproductive tissue and are not passed on the dna of the germ cells for example; the size of the beetles in the population decreased due to scarcity of food
23755,"inherited trait: inherited traits are caused due to changes in the dna of germ cells which are inherited from generation to generation, for example; formation of green beetles in the population of red beetles"
23756,(i) these are the traits which are passed from one generation to the next
23757,charles darwin’s idea of evolution: his concept of evolution was based on the idea that new species were formed due to variations that occurred in the organisms nature played an important role in selecting the organisms having suitable variations
23758,speciation: it means the development of one or more species from an existing species the factors that could lead to rise of a new species are : gene flow: it means the exchange of genetic material by interbreeding between populations of the same species or between individuals within a population
23759,it increases the variation in the genetic composition of a population
23760,genetic drift: it is random change in the frequency of alleles in a populate over successive generation due to errors in the gametes
23761,genetic drift can lead to accumulation of changes in the generations
23762,"natural selection: according to darwin, natural selection also plays an important role in bringing about evolution of new species of plants and animals"
23763,according to him variations existed between the individuals of a population and some natural phenomena eliminated those individuals which were less adapted
23764,the surviving population would pass the hereditary advantageous features to their offsprings
23765,with time this process would give rise to organisms different from the original population and new species are formed
23766,"isolation: when a population of a species splits into two, it cannot reproduce with each other and forms a new species, for example; when a population of beetles feed on bushes on a mountain range, some may start feeding on nearby bushes finding entry into a new subpopulation"
23767,they reproduce with them so genes enter in a new population
23768,ultimately the two groups will be incapable of reproducing with each other and new species will be formed
23769,"evolution and classification: the organisms show certain features, like appearance and behaviour which are called characteristics for example; plants can perform photosynthesis"
23770,the basic characteristics are shared by a large number of organisms
23771,"more characteristics which two species have in common more closely are related, if they are more closely related then they have common ancestors (explain the example of brother sister and cousins)"
23772,"evolutionary relationships can be traced with the help of the following : homologous organs: those organs which have the same basic structural design and developmental origin but perform different functions and appearance, for example; forelimbs of frog, lizard, bird, bat and human beings"
23773,they have same design of bones but they perform different functions
23774,"analogous organs: those organs which have different basic design and developmental origin but have similar appearance and perform a similar function, for example; wings of bat and bird"
23775,study of fossils: fossils are preserved remains of living organisms that lived in the past
23776,when living organisms die their bodies decompose but some parts of their body may be in such an environment that they do not decompose for example; if a dead insect gets caught in hot mud it will not decompose quickly but the mud will harden and retain impressions of the body parts of the insects
23777,these impressions are also called fossils: the age of fossil can be estimated in two ways : the fossils that occur closer to earth surface are more recent to those found in deeper layers
23778,detecting the ratio of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material
23779,significance of fossils: fossils are formed layer by layer in the earths crust
23780,the animals and plants which existed earlier are buried in the deeper layer which ones found in the upper layer
23781,"it is found that, deeper fossils have simpler structure than found than upper layer"
23782,"complete fossil record of animals like horse, camel, man has helped us to study the stages of evolution"
23783,"evolution by stages: evolution is a continuous and gradual process, complicated organs did not evolve by a single dna change but were formed by bit by bit change over generations for example; complex organs like eyes were created by bit by bit changes, in between the rudimentary eye in some insects also provided a fitness advantage"
23784,the structure of eye in all organisms is different enough to have evolutionary origins
23785,"some organs even developed for one particular function but later become useful for quite a different function, e.g feathers developed to provide warmth to the animal but later helped in flight"
23786,"some dinosaurs had feathers although they could not fly, this shows that birds are closely related to reptiles, since dinosaurs were reptiles some dissimilar looking structures also evolved from common ancestors"
23787,"selection for arrested flower development had led to broccoli, selection for sterile flowers had made cauliflower, selection for swollen-stem had formed kohlrabi"
23788,"selection for large leaves had formed leafy vegetable kale, selection for colored leaves formed red cabbage"
23789,to sum up we can say that evolutionary relationships can be established by study of homologous organs study of analogous organs study of fossils changes in dna during reproduction evolution versus progress: evolution can not be called progress from lower forms to higher forms
23790,it is basically forming more complex designs while the simpler once also keep growing
23791,evolution is generation of diversity with the help of environmental selection
23792,bacteria which were formed first have the capacity to live in diverse conditions and are still flourishing; on the other hand human beings which are highly evolved species can not be called the pinnacle of evolution but yet another species in the evolving life forms
23793,human evolution: human evolution has been studied with the help of excavation; time dating and fossil study all human beings belong to single species i.e
23794,"west asia, central asia, eurasia, south asia and east asia they traveled to indonesia, the philippines, australia and america they traveled forward and backward sometimes separating and sometimes coming back to mix with each other"
23795,although there is a great diversity of human forms all over the world get all humans are single species
23796,heredity: it means the transmission of features/characters/traits from one generation to the next generation
23797,variation: the differences among the individuals of a species/population are called variations
23798,gregor johann mendel started his experiments on plant breeding and hybridisation
23799,sex determination: phenomenon of decision or determination of sex of an offspring
23800,"factors responsible for sex determination: environmental: in some animals, the temperature at which the fertilised eggs are kept decides the gender"
23801,genetic: in some animals like humans gender or individual is determined by a pair of chromosomes called sex chromosomes (xx – female; xy – male)
23802,"sex chromosomes: in human beings, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes"
23803,out of these 22 chromosome pairs are called autosomes and the last pair of chromosomes that help in deciding the gender of that individual are called sex chromosome
23804,xx – female; xy – male the cross done shows that half the children will be boys and half will be girls
23805,all children will inherit an x chromosome from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or girls
23806,"thus sex of children will be determined by what they inherit from their father, and not from their mother"
23807,acquired traits: these are the traits which are developed in an individual due to special conditions
23808,"they cannot direct evolution, for example, the low weight of starving beetles"
23809,inherited traits: these are the traits which are passed from one generation to the next
23810,"they are helpful in evolution, for example, the colour of eyes and hair"
23811,microevolution: it is the evolution which takes place on a small scale
23812,a species is a group of similar individuals that belong to a population that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring
23813,speciation takes place when the variation is combined with geographical isolation
23814,gene flow: it is the exchange of genetic material by interbreeding between populations of the same species or individuals
23815,gene flow occurs between populations that are partly but not completely separated
23816,genetic drift: it is the random change in the frequency of alleles (gene pair) in a population over successive generations
23817,genetic drift takes place due to: severe changes in the dna
23818,natural selection: the process by which nature selects and consolidates those organisms which are more suitably adapted and possesses favourable variations
23819,the more characteristics two species have in common the more closely they are related
23820,"the more closely they are related, the more recently they have a common ancestor"
23821,similarities among organisms allow us to group them together and to study their characteristics
23822,these are the organs that have same basic structural plan and origin but different functions
23823,"example, forelimb of a horse (running), wings of bat (flying), paw of a cat (walk/ scratch/ attack) — same basic structure but different functions"
23824,analogous organs: these are the organs that have different origin and structural plan but same functions
23825,"example, wings of a bat (elongated fingers with skin folds), wings of bird (feathery covering along the arm) — different structures but same functions"
23826,fossils: the remains and relics of dead organisms that lived in the remote past
23827,"example, a fossil called archaeopteryx has feathered wings like birds but teeth and tail like reptiles hence suggesting that birds and reptiles had a common ancestor"
23828,artificial selection: humans have been a powerful agent in modifying wild species to suit their own requirement throughout ages by using artificial selection
23829,heredity : it refers to the transmission of characters or traits from the parents to their offspring
23830,heredity is the continuity of features from one generation to another which are present in fertilised egg or zygote
23831,the zygote develops into an organism of a particular type only
23832,genetics : it is the branch of biology which deals with heredity and variation
23833,genetics is to help our understanding of heredity by knowing how offspring inherit characteristics from their parents
23834,variation : it means the differences in the characters or traits among the individuals of a species
23835,variations occur during reproduction both because of error in dna copying and as a result of sexual reproduction
23836,it causes adaptations due to which organism can easily adjust to its changing environment
23837,variations are produced both in sexual and asexual reproduction but amount of variations produced in asexual reproduction are subtle (so little) that they are hardly noticeable as compared to variations caused due to sexual reproduction
23838,"genotype : the genetic constitution of an organism e.g., genotype of human male is 44 + xy and genotype of human female is 44 + xx 5"
23839,"phenotype : the appearance of the organism, i.e., the way in which genotype is expressed"
23840,phenotype is the result of interaction of genes with the environment
23841,"e.g., red colour may be controlled by a pair of genes rr"
23842,now if genotype is rr phenotype will be red only but if genotype is rr then also phenotype will be red since r is a dominant gene
23843,gene : it is the basic unit of inheritance by which characters are transferred from parents to their offspring
23844,gene consists of a specific length of dna on a chromosome
23845,a specific segment of dna that provides the information for one protein is called gene for that protein
23846,"according to mendel, both parents must contribute equally to the dna of the progeny during sexual reproduction"
23847,"as both parents determine the trait in the progeny, so both parents must be contributing a copy of the same gene"
23848,chromosomes : these are the long threads present in the nucleus of every cell
23849,each gene set is present as separate independent pieces each called a chromosome
23850,"each cell have two copies of each chromosome, one each from male and female parents"
23851,every germ cell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either maternal or paternal origin
23852,"when two germ cells combine, they will restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring the stability of the dna of the species"
23853,such mechanism of inheritance is used by all sexually and asexually reproducing organisms
23854,"allele: it is an alternative form of a gene occupying the same position on a chromosome and affecting the same characters but in two alternative ways, e.g., the free and attached ear lobe are the alleles of ear lobe character"
23855,"expressing allele of a gene : homozygous dominant in capital letters, e.g., tallness(tt) homozygous recessive in smalmetters, e.g., shortness or dwarfness (tt) heterozygous (tt)-lt will be called hybrid tall"
23856,dominant allele: an allele that affects the phenotype of an organism both in heterozygous and homozygous condition
23857,"it is denoted by a capital letter, e.g., tallness in pea plant is denoted by ‘t"
23858,"recessive allele: an allele that affects the phenotype of the organism in absence of a dominant allele, i.e., in homozygous recessive individuals"
23859,"it is denoted by a small alphabet, e.g., dwarfness in pea plant is denoted by’t’"
23860,"homozygous: when both alleles of a particular gene are the same, e.g., tt 12"
23861,"heterozygous : when both alleles of a particular gene are different, e.g., tt 13"
23862,"diploid : cells or organism containing two sets of genes, e.g., human body cells"
23863,"haploid : cells or organism containing one set of genes, e.g., human reproductive cells (sperms and ova)"
23864,"monohybrid cross : a cross between two parents taking the alternative traits of one single character, e.g., a cross between tall and dwarf pea plants"
23865,monohybrid ratio : in f1 generation : 100% hybrid in f2 generation : phenotypic ratio is 3 : 1 and genotypic ratio is 1 : 2 : 1 16
23866,"dihybrid cross: a cross between two parents taking into consideration alternative traits of two different characters, e.g., a cross between two pea plants one having round, green seeds and the other having wrinkled, yellow seeds"
23867,f2 ratio : phenotypic is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 and genotypic
23868,"human blood groups: there are four types of blood groups a, b, ab or o"
23869,"these are controlled by a gene which is denoted by symbols ia, ib and io (sometimes also denoted as i)"
23870,"the genes ia and ib show no dominance over each other (they are codominant, i.e., both expresses themselves independently)"
23871,"therefore, blood group of a person depends on the type of genes present, e.g., (i) blood group a has the following gene types : 18"
23872,determining sex of a newborn individual genetically: in human beings the sex of the individual is ” determined genetically
23873,there are 23 pairs of chromosomes of which 22 are similar in male and female and are known as autosomes
23874,the remaining one is sex chromosome which is xy in males and xx in females
23875,"males produce two types of sperms x and y, while female produces one type of egg x"
23876,if a x type of sperm fertilizers the egg then the sex of baby will be female (xx)
23877,if y type of sperm fertilizers the egg then the sex of the baby will be male (xy)
23878,mendel’s experiment to show that traits may be dominant or recessive: mendel conducted breeding experiments in garden pea
23879,found that three-quarter of the plants was tall and one quarter was short
23880,"homologous chromosomes: a pair of corresponding chromosomes of the same shape and size, one from each parent"
23881,autosomes and sex chromosomes : the identical » chromosome pairs are called autosomes
23882,1-22 pairs are autosomes while 23rd pair (xx in females and xy in males) which are designated as x and y are sex chromosomes
23883,molecular phylogeny: it is the study of evolutionary relationships by comparing dna of different species
23884,"natural selection : natural selection is one of the basic mechanisms of evolution, along with mutation, migration and genetic drift"
23885,"natural selection means the environmental conditions prevailing around an organism against which organism adapts itself, grows – and reproduces further"
23886,this leads to a change in the composition of genes within a population further causing evolution
23887,"thus, it can be said that, natural selection results in adaptation in population to fit their environment better"
23888,"thus, natural selection direct evolution in the population of a particular species"
23889,"fossils of the information which they provide regarding evolution: fossils are the remains of ancient life forms, which got preserved somehow in the layers of earth, snow or oil"
23890,information given by fossils: they reveal that the life forms which existed earlier do not exist today which indicate that the living forms are ever changing (evolving)
23891,they are used to guess the time when a particular organism existed on earth
23892,genetic drift: the change in the frequency of some genes in a population which provides diversity without any survival advantage is called genetic drift
23893,"the various ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population : differences in population are responsible for the diversity such as, colour of eyes, hair, shape of ear lobes"
23894,this occurs due to : (i) sexual reproduction (ii) inaccuracies during dna replication (iii) due to environmental changes
23895,this diversity will increase with time as these variations can be passed on only through dna/genes during reproduction through reproductive tissue (germ cells or gametes)
23896,"if these variations give survival advantage, then such traits are selected in nature and such traits increase in a population"
23897,it results in the change in gene frequency in a particular: population
23898,migration which leads to gene flow in and out of the population
23899,evidence of evolution: errors in dna copying (mutation) and sexual reproduction lead to variations which form the basis of evolution
23900,characteristics that are common in different kinds of living organisms provide evidence in favour of evolution
23901,"28.evolution : evolution can be defined as a naturally occurring slow, continuous and irreversible process of change"
23902,the gradual change of living organisms from pre-existing organisms since the beginning of life is called organic evolution
23903,"whereas, gradual change in elements from one form to another with time is termed as inorganic evolution, i"
23904,29.inherited traits : are those traits which are passed from one generation to another through specific genes
23905,any change in dna of the germ cells will be passed
23906,"acquired traits : are those traits which are acquired by the organism in its lifetime, e.g., removal of tail cannot change the genes of the germ cells of the mice thus cannot be passed to next generation"
23907,speciation : it means the origin of new species from the existing ones
23908,it happens when different populations of the same species evolve along different lines
23909,it occurs when two populations are isolated (both geographically and reproductively) leading to almost no gene flow between the two populations
23910,"over generations, genetic drift will accumulate different changes in each sub-population"
23911,together natural selection and genetic drift will cause such changes (severe changes in the dna) that these two groups will not be able to reproduce with each other even if they happen to meet
23912,"when dna changes occur to larger extent, it may lead to change in the number of chromosomes or gene expression, eventually the germ cells of the two groups cannot fuse with each other"
23913,"estimating age of fossil: there are 2 methods : relative method : on digging, the fossils which are closer to the surface are more recent than the fossils found in deeper layers"
23914,"dating fossils (carbon dating method): it is done by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element (i.e., isotope of c-14 which is radioactive) in the fossil material"
23915,"evolution by stages : complex organs like eye has evolved from rudimentary organs, (e.g., rudimentary eye in flatworm might be useful enough to give only a fitness advantage and the structure of eye in different organisms is different indicating them to have different evolutionary origins) not by a single dna change but created bit-by-bit over generations"
23916,"a change that is useful for one property to start with can become useful later for quite a different function (e.g., feathers might start as providing insulation in cold weather"
23917,some heavy birds and reptiles also have feathers but they do not fly
23918,"some very dissimilar looking structures evolve from a common ancestral design, e.g., wild cabbage was cultivated as a food plant and many different vegetables were generated by selection over last two thousand years, (a) selection of very small distances between the leaves gave rise to cabbage we eat"
23919,"(b) selection for arrested flower development gave rise to broccoli, (c) selection for sterile flowers gave rise to cauliflower (d) selection for swollen parts gave rise to kohlrabi.(e) selection for larger leaves gave rise to leafy vegetable kale"
23920,"it suggests that, if these selections were not done then there would have been only wild cabbage"
23921,"homologous organs are organs having same origin and basic structure but they appear different and perform different functions in various organisms, e.g., forelimbs of horse and arms of man"
23922,"similarities in basic structure of (homologous) organs in different organisms, indifferent groups indicate common ancestry"
23923,"analogous organs are organs, which look similar because they perform same function, but they do not have same origin and basic structure"
23924,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 10 science notes chapter 9 heredity and evolution, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
23925,limitations law of octaves was applicable only upto calcium (only for lighter elements)
23926,"for example; co and ni with fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine"
23927,"according to newland, only 56 elements existed in nature and no more elements would be discovered in future"
23928,"present attempts for the classification of elements: mendeleev’s periodic table, the modern periodic table"
23929,mendeleev’s periodic table: mendeleev’s periodic table is based on the physical and chemical properties of elements and their atomic masses
23930,mendeleev’s periodic law: according to this “the physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses.” periodicity of properties: the repetition of properties of elements after certain regular intervals is known as periodicity of properties
23931,merits of mendeleev’s periodic table mendeleev’s left vacant places in his table which provided an idea for the discovery of new elements
23932,mendeleev’s periodic table was predicted properties of several undiscovered elements on the basis of their position in mendeleev’s periodic table
23933,it is useful in correcting the doubtful atomic masses of some elements
23934,noble gases could accommodate in the mendeleev’s periodic table without disturbing the periodic table after discovery
23935,limitations of mendeleev’s periodic table (a) no fixed position for hydrogen: no correct position of the hydrogen atom was in mendeleev’s periodic table
23936,example: position of hydrogen with alkali metals and halogens (17th group)
23937,(b) no place for isotopes: position of isotopes were not decided
23938,(c) no regular trend in atomic mass: position of some elements with lower atomic masses before with higher atomic mass
23939,"mendeleev’s original periodic table is reproduced in the table below the modern periodic table: in 1913, henry moseley showed that the atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property than its atomic mass"
23940,modern period law: the physical and chemical properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic number
23941,atomic number (z) is equal to the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom of an element
23942,modern periodic table contains 18 vertical column known as group and seven horizontal rows known as periods
23943,"on moving from left to right in a period, the number of valence electrons increases from 1 to 8 in the elements present"
23944,"on moving from left to right in a period, number of shell remains same"
23945,all the elements of a group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons
23946,"trends in modern periodic table: valency, atomic size, metallic and non-metallic characters, and electronegativity"
23947,(i) valency: the valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the outermost shell of its atom (i.e
23948,the combining capacity of an element is known as its valency)
23949,"in period: on moving from left to right in a period, the valency first increases from 1 to 4 and then decreases to zero (0)"
23950,"in groups: on moving from top to bottom in a group, the valency remains same because the number of valence electrons remains the same"
23951,example: valency of first group elements = 1 valency of second group elements = 2
23952,(ii) atomic size: atomic size refers to radius of an atom
23953,it is a distance between the centre of the nucleus and the outermost shell of an isolated atom
23954,"in period : on moving from left to right in a period, atomic size decreases because nuclear charge increases"
23955,example: size of second period elements: li > be > b > c > n > o > f point to know: the atomic size of noble gases in corresponding period is largest due to presence of fully filled electronic configuration (i.e
23956,in group: atomic size increases down the group because new shells are being added in spite of the increase in nuclear charge
23957,example ; atomic size of first group element : li < na < k < rb < cs < fr atomic size of 17th group elements : f < cl < br < i (iii) metallic character: it is the tendency of an atom to lose electrons
23958,"in period: along the period from left to right, metallic characters decreases because a tendency to lose electron decreases due to the increase in nuclear charge"
23959,"example: metallic character of second period elements: li > be > b > c >> n > o > f in group: metallic character, when moving from top to bottom increases because the atomic size and tendency to lose electrons increases"
23960,example: first group element : li < na < k < rb < cs 17th group elements: f < cl < br < i (iv) non-metallic character: it is tendency of an atom to gain electrons
23961,"in period: along the period from left to right, non-metallic character increases because tendency to gain electrons increases due to increase in nucleus charge"
23962,"example ; non-metallic character of 2nd period elements : li < be < b < c < n < o < f in group: on moving from top to bottom in a group, non-metallic character decreases because atomic size increases and tendency to gain electrons decreases"
23963,non-metallic character of 17th period element: f > cl > br > i (v) chemical reactivity in metals: chemical reactivity of metals increases down the group because tendency to lose electrons increases
23964,example ; li < na < k < rb < cs (1st group) in non-metals: chemical reactivity of non-metals decreases down the group because tendency to gain electrons decreases
23965,example: f > cl > br > i (17th group) (vi) electronegativity: it is tendency of an element to attract the shared pair of electrons towards it in a covalently bonded molecule
23966,it increases with increase of nuclear charge or decrease in atomic size
23967,example ;li < be < b < c < n < o < f
23968,example ; li > na > k > rb > cs f > cl > br > i (vii) nature of oxides: metal oxides are basic in nature
23969,"cl2o7, so3, p2o5, in the case of metal reactivity, it increases down the group because of the tendency to lose electrons increases"
23970,"in the case of non-metal reactivity, decreases down the group because of the tendency to gain electrons decreases"
23971,"group: the vertical columns in mendeleev’s, as well as in modern periodic table, are called groups"

23973,there are 18 groups and 7 (seven) periods in the modern periodic table
23974,atomic size: the atomic size may be visualised as the distance between the centre of the nucleus and the outermost shell of an isolated atom
23975,"the trend of atomic size (radius) in moving down a group: ongoing down in a group of the periodic table, the atomic size increases because a new shell of electrons is added to the atoms at every step"
23976,there is an increase in distance between the outermost shell electrons and the nucleus of the atom
23977,"the trend of atomic size (radius) in moving from left to right in a period: on moving from left to right along a period, the size of atoms decreases because on moving from left to right, the atomic number of elements increases which means that the number of protons and electrons in the atoms increases"
23978,"due to the large positive charge on the nucleus, the electrons are pulled in more closely to the nucleus and the size of the atom decreases"
23979,these elements of a triad show specific trends in their physical properties
23980,the atomic mass of the middle element was roughly the average of the atomic masses of the other two elements
23981,"example: atomic mass of na is 23 in the triad li, na and k"
23982,this atomic mass is the average of the atomic masses of li and k which have atomic masses 7 and 39 respectively
23983,1st triad li – lithium na – sodium k – potassium 2nd triad ca – calcium sr – strontium ba – barium 3rd triad cl – chlorine br – bromine i – iodine mendeleev’s periodic law: it states that “the properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic masses.” it means the properties of the elements depend on their atomic masses and the elements are given a position in the periodic table on the basis of their increasing atomic masses
23984,merits of mendeleev’s periodic table (i) mendeleev left a number of gaps in his table to accommodate the new elements which would be discovered later on
23985,"he even predicted the properties of some of these elements and named them as eka-boron, eka-aluminium and eka-silicon respectively"
23986,"later on the elements were discovered, for example, gallium replaced eka-aluminium and it showed properties similar to that of aluminium"
23987,"(ii) he gave the proper position to the noble gases which were discovered later on, without disturbing the existing order of elements"
23988,limitations of mendeleev’s classification: the position of isotopes could not be explained because isotopes have the same chemical properties but different atomic masses
23989,"if the elements are arranged according to atomic masses, the isotopes should be placed in different groups of the periodic table"
23990,the atomic masses do not increase in a regular manner in going from one element to the next
23991,he could not assign a correct position to hydrogen in his table because hydrogen has some properties similar to alkali metals and some properties similar to halogens
23992,"modem periodic law: this law was proposed by henry moseley, a scientist in 1913"
23993,"according to this law, “properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic number.” it means that the properties of elements depend on their atomic number and the elements are given positions in the periodic table on the basis of their increasing atomic number"
23994,"as atomic number determines the distribution of electrons in the orbits, and electrons of the outermost orbit determine the properties of an element"

23999,no fixed position was given to hydrogen in this periodic table
24000,trends in modem periodic table (i) valency: elements belonging to the same group have the same number of valence electrons and thus the same valency
24001,valency in a particular period from left to right first increases as positive valency and then decreases as negative valency
24002,"example: in elements of 2nd period: li has 1+ valency, then be2+, b3+, c4+ covalency, n3- valency, then o2- and f(-) valency"
24003,(ii) the atomic size or atomic radius increases: as we move down in a group and it decreases as we move from left to right in a period
24004,atomic size increases down a group due to the increase in the number of shells
24005,atomic size decreases along a period due to an increase in the nuclear charge which tends to pull the electrons closer to the nucleus and reduces the size of the atom
24006,(iii) metallic and non-metallic properties: in the modern periodic table metals are on the left side and non-metals on the right side of the table
24007,metallic characters decrease from left to right in a period and increase while going down in a group
24008,non-metallic characters increase from left to right in a period due to increase in the electronegativity and these characters decrease from top to bottom in a group due to the decrease in the electronegativity of atoms while going down in a group

24025,the elements with similar physical and chemical properties came under the same groups
24026,mendeleev’s periodic law: the properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses
24027,"achievements of mendeleev’s periodic table: through this table, it was very easy to study the physical and chemical properties of various elements"
24028,"mendeleev adjusted few elements with a slightly greater atomic mass before the elements with slightly lower atomic mass, so that elements with similar properties could be grouped together"
24029,he predicted the existence of some elements that had not been discovered at that time
24030,"his predictions were quite true as elements like scandium, gallium and germanium were discovered later"
24031,"the gases like helium, neon and argon, which were discovered later, were placed in a new group without disturbing the existing order"

24042,(iii) table showing electronic configuration of first 20 elements: trends in the modern periodic table: valency: valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the outermost shell of its atom
24043,valency of elements in a period first increases from one to four and then decreases to zero
24044,atomic size: atomic size refers to the radius of an atom
24045,"in a period, atomic size and radii decreases from left to right"
24046,"in a group, atomic size and radii increases from top to bottom"
24047,"the tendency to gain electrons from the outermost shell of an atom, is called non-metallic character of an element"

24076,nomenclature of organic compounds: it is difficult to remember millions of compounds by their individual common name
24077,"thus, to systematize the nomenclature of organic compounds iupac (international union of pure and applied chemistry) has given certain rule which is as follows: 1"
24078,"combustion: the complete combustion of carbon compounds in the air gives carbon dioxide water, heat and light"
24079,ch3ch2oh(l) + o2(g) → co2(g) + h2o(l) + heat and light carbon burns in air or oxygen to give carbon dioxide and heat and light
24080,c(s) + o2(g) → co2(g) + heat and light saturated hydrocarbons burn with a blue flame in the presence of a sufficient supply of air or oxygen
24081,"ch4(g) + 2o2(g) → co2(g) + 2h2o(l) + heat and light in presence of limited supply of air, saturated hydrocarbon forms a sooty flame"
24082,"the gas and kerosene stove used at home has inlet for air so that, burnt to given clean blue flame"
24083,"due to presence of small amount of nitrogen and sulphur, coal and petroleum produces carbon dioxide with oxides of nitrogen and sulphur which are major pollutant"
24084,oxidation: oxidation of ethanol in presence of oxidizing agents gives ethanoic acid
24085,"oxidizing agent: some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others, are known as oxidising agent"
24086,example: alkaline kmno4 (or kmno4—koh) acidified k2cr2o7 (or k2cr2o7—h2so4) kmno4 – potassium permanganate k2cr2o7 – potassium dichromate 3
24087,addition reaction: addition of dihydrogen with unsaturated hydrocarbon in the presence of catalysts such as nickel or platinum or palladium are known as hydrogenation (addition) reaction
24088,catalyst: substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceeds to different rate without consuming in it are called a catalyst
24089,process of converting vegetable oil into solid fat (vegetable ghee) is called hydrogenation of oil
24090,vegetable oil + h2 \(\xrightarrow [ ni\quad catalyst ]{ \triangle }\)  vegetable ghee vegetable fats are saturated fats which are harmful for health
24091,substitution reaction: replacement of one or more hydrogen atom of an organic molecule by another atom or group of the atom is known as substitution reaction

24101,general formula: rcoo–na+ detergent: ammonium and sulphonate salts of long chain fatty acids are called detergent
24102,hard and soft water: water that does not produce lather with soap readily is called hard water and which produces lather with soap is called soft water
24103,"hardness of water is due to the presence of bicarbonates, chlorides and sulphate salt of calcium and magnesium"
24104,(i) these are ammonium and sulphonate salts of long chain fatty acids
24105,(ii) ionic part of the soap is —coo–na+ (ii) ionic part of detergent is —oso3-na+
24106,(iii) their efficiency decreases in hard water (iii) their efficiency is unaffected in hard water
24107,advantage of detergents: the main advantage of detergent over soaps is that soaps cannot be used in hard water for washing because hard water reacts with soap to form curdy white precipitate called scum
24108,"thus, in hard water, soap does not give lather while detergent does"
24109,cleansing action of soaps and detergents: both soaps and detergents cantains two parts
24110,a long hydrocarbon part which is hydrophobic (water repelling) in nature and a short ionic part which is hydrophillic (water attracting) in nature

24114,covalency: the number of electrons contributed by each atom for sharing
24115,carbon always forms a covalent bond: atomic no of carbon is 6
24116,"therefore, it should either lose or gain 4 electrons to achieve the noble gas configuration and become stable"
24117,"however, it is difficult for carbon to gain or lose four electrons because of the following reasons: it cannot gain 4 electrons to form c4- ion having neon gas (2, 8) configuration because this anion would be highly unstable due to a large amount of energy required to overcome the forces of repulsion between the four electrons being added and the six electrons already present in the carbon atom"
24118,it cannot lose 4 electrons to form c4+ ion having helium gas (2) configuration because this cation would be highly unstable due to a large amount of energy required to remove four electrons from the carbon atom

24130,the members of a homologous series show a gradation in physical properties
24131,nomenclature of carbon compound: international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac) decided some rules to name the carbon compounds
24132,names which are given on this basis are popularly known as iupac name
24133,the rules for nomenclature are as follows: (i) identify the number of carbon atoms in the carbon compound
24134,name the carbon compounds according to the number of carbon atoms
24135,"example, saturated hydrocarbon having one carbon atom is named as methane"
24136,an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a double bond having two carbon atoms is named as ethene
24137,an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a triple bond between carbon atoms is named as ethyne
24138,"(ii) if the structure has a branched chain, identify the longest chain and then identify the number of carbon atoms"
24139,"(iii) in the case of a functional group present, write the prefix or suffix of the functional group as given below"
24140,then write the name of the parent compound: chemical properties of ethanol ethanol (c2h5oh) compound is a colourless liquid at room temperature
24141,it is the second member of the homologous series of alcohols
24142,it has a very low melting point (156 k) and low boiling point (351 k or 78°c)
24143,"it is a neutral substance, so it does not have any effect on either blue litmus solution or red litmus solution"
24144,it bums with a blue flame in the presence of o2 of air
24145,"in the presence of alkaline kmno4, it is oxidised to ethanoic acid"

24153,it reacts with carbonate and hydrogen-carbonate compounds of metals to form its salt (sodium ethanoate commonly called sodium acetate) and release co2 gas
24154,cleansing action of soap: the dirt is generally held to the surface of a dirty cloth by a thin film of oil or grease
24155,"when a dirty cloth is treated with soap or detergent solution, the non- polar tail of the soap or the detergent dissolve in oil or grease while the polar heads are held by the surrounding water"
24156,soap or detergent micelle is formed with the oily or greasy dirt lying at their centre (soap or detergent is attracted both by the greasy dirt and water
24157,"when the surface of the cloth is mechanically scrubbed or beaten on a stone or with a wooden paddle or agitated in a washing machine, the loosened oily particle is removed from the dirty surface and the cloth is cleaned"
24158,"detergents lower the surface tension of water to a greater extent than soap, therefore the cleansing action of detergent is much higher than those of soaps"
24159,"the earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates^bicarbonates, coal, and petroleum)"
24160,"3. in spite of its small amount available in nature, carbon is a versatile element as it forms the basis for all living organisms and many things which we use"
24161,bonding in carbon : the atomic number of carbon = 6 an electronic configuration has 2 electrons in k shell and 4 electrons in l shell
24162,"in order to attain the noble gas configuration, carbon should either gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons or can share it’s 4 electrons with some other element"
24163,"the gain of 4 electrons (to form an octet, i.e., 8 electrons in c4- anion) is difficult because then a nucleus with 6 protons will have to hold extra four electrons"
24164,"loss of 4 electrons (to attain duplet, i.e., 2 electrons like he atom in c4+ cation) is difficult as it requires a large amount of energy to remove four electrons"
24165,"carbon, hence, overcomes this difficulty by sharing it’s four valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements"
24166,these electrons contributed by the atoms for mutual sharing in order to acquire the stable noble gas configuration is called covalency of that atom
24167,"the simplest molecule formed by sharing of electrons (i.e., covalent bonds), can be represented by electron dot structure"
24168,"allotropes of carbon: the phenomenon by means of which an element can exist in two or more forms, with similar chemical properties but different physical properties are called allotropy and the different forms are called allotropes"
24169,carbon shows three allotropic forms : note: diamond is the hardest substance whereas graphite is very soft
24170,diamond is used for grinding and polishing of ‘ hard materials and graphite is used as a lubricant
24171,diamond has a three-dimensional rigid structure but graphite has a hexagonal sheet layer structure
24172,diamond is a bad conductor of electricity but graphite is a very good conductor of electricity

24174,"the first fullerene identified was c-60 with 60 carbon atoms arranged like the geodesic dome designed by us architect, buckminster fuller, hence these are also known as buckminster fullerenes or bucky ball structures"
24175,"(c) multiple bond formation : small size of carbon also enables it to form multiple bonds, (i.e., double bonds or triple bonds) with other elements as well as with its own atoms"
24176,note: compounds of carbon with double bonds and triple bonds are called as unsaturated compounds while those with carbon-carbon single bonds are called saturated compounds
24177,"alkenes (with —c = c —) and alkynes (with —c = c—) are hence unsaturated, whereas alkanes (with — c — c—) are saturated compounds"
24178,"(d) isomerism: the phenomenon by means of which the carbon compounds with same molecular formula show different structures, and properties, e.g., a chain of 4 carbon atoms can be written in two ways : hence, the number of carbon compounds increases to a huge number"
24179,"hydrocarbons: a large number of hydrocarbons can be classified as: note: in an open chain, the name of parent chain is derived from the root word and suffix ane, ene or yne is added depending on the type of bond present in a chain : important: no alkene or alkyne is possible with single carbon atom because double or triple bond is not possible between carbon and hydrogen atom"
24180,"functional group: an atom or a group of atoms which when present in a compound gives specific properties to it, is called a functional group"
24181,"a single line shown along with a functional group is called as its free valency by which it gets attached to a compound by replacing one hydrogen atom or atoms, e.g., -cl"
24182,"functional group, replacing the hydrogen is also called as heteroatom because it is different from carbon, and can be nitrogen, sulphur, or halogen, etc"
24183,important: replacement of hydrogen atom by a functional group is always in such a manner that valency of carbon remains satisfied
24184,note : cl is named as prefix chloro; br as bromo; nh2 as amino and n02 as nitro
24185,important note: symbol ‘r’ in a formula represents an alkyl group which is formed by the removal of one hydrogen atom from an alkane
24186,homologous series: a series of organic compounds in which every succeeding member differs from the previous one by -ch2 group or 14 a.m.u
24187,"note : as the molecular mass increases in a series, : so physical properties of the compounds show a variation, but chemical properties which are determined solely by a functional group, remains same within a series"
24188,"nomenclature of organic compounds trivial or common names: these names were given after the source from which the organic compounds were first isolated, e.g., if a compound has one carbon atom, then its common name will have root word form and so on (see table)"
24189,iupac name: international union of pure and applied chemistry gave following rules for naming various compounds : identify the number of carbon atoms and write the word root corresponding to it

24191,"presence of a functional group is indicated by prefix or suffix as given in table 2, and table 3"
24192,"if the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, the last letter ‘e’ in the name of the compound is deleted and the suffix is added"
24193,"e.g., a ketone with three carbon atoms is named as : propane – e = propan + ‘one’ = propanone"
24194,"halogens, in iupac, are written as prefixes, e.g., compound with two carbons and one chloro group is named as chloroethane (ch3ch2ci)"
24195,chemical properties of carbon compounds : main properties of carbon compounds are : (a) combustion reaction (b) oxidation reaction (c) addition reaction
24196,(d) substitution reaction (a) combustion reaction: a chemical reaction in which a substance burns in the presence of air or oxygen is called combustion reaction
24197,"note: combustion is always an exothermic reaction, e.g., remember: saturated hydrocarbons generally give clean flame whereas unsaturated hydrocarbons give sooty flame (because carbon content is more than hydrogen content in these, and hence carbon shows incomplete combustion and appears as soot)"
24198,saturated hydrocarbons can give sooty flame in a limited supply of oxygen
24199,(b) oxidation reaction: the addition of oxygen in a compound upon combustion is called oxidation
24200,"in addition to combustion, oxidation can also be : brought about by some substances which are capable of giving oxygen to others, i.e., oxidising agents, e.g., acidified k2cr207 (potassium dichromate) and alkaline kmn04 (potassium permanganate)"
24201,"note: (c) addition reaction: addition of a molecule in unsaturated compounds in the presence of a catalyst, to give saturated compound is called an addition reaction, e.g., hydrogenation of vegetable oils as shown in the reaction below : (d) substitution reaction: the reactions which involve the replacement of an atom or group of atoms from a molecule by another atom without any change in structure in the remaining part of the molecule"
24202,"ethanol: (or alcohol) colourless liquid, soluble in water, and has a distinct smell and burning taste"
24203,its consumption in small quantities causes drunkenness and can be lethal
24204,and 100% pure acetic acid is called glacial acetic acid because it has m.pt
24205,reactions of ethanoic acid : saponification : esters in the presence of acid or base react to give back alcohol and carboxylic acid is called saponification
24206,soaps and detergents : soaps and synthetic detergents: soaps and detergents are substances used for cleaning
24207,"soap: soaps are sodium or potassium salts of higher fatty acids, such as oleic acid (c17h33cooh), stearic acid (c17h35cooh), palmitic acid (c15h31cooh), etc"
24208,these acids are present in the form of their esters along with glycerol (alcohol containing three hydroxyl groups)
24209,"these esters, called ‘glycerides’ are present in fats and oils of animal and vegetable origin"
24210,"preparation of soap: when an oil or fat (glyceride) is treated with sodium hydroxide solution, it gets converted to sodium salt of the acid (soap) and glycerol"
24211,"detergents: chemically, detergents are sodium salts of sulphonic acids, i.e., detergents contain a sulphonic acid group (—s03h), instead^of a carboxylic acid group (—cooh), on one end of the hydrocarbon"
24212,the cleansing action of detergent is considered to be more effective than a soap
24213,cleansing action of soaps and detergents: the cleansing action of soaps and detergents follows the same principle
24214,"when soap or detergent is dissolved in water, the molecules gather together as clusters, called micelles"
24215,"when water is agitated, the oily dirt tends to lift off from the dirty surface and dissociates into fragments"
24216,this gives an opportunity to other tails to stick to oil
24217,the solution now contains small globules of oil surrounded by detergent molecules
24218,the negatively charged heads present in water prevent the small globules from coming together and form aggregates
24219,scum: the insoluble precipitates formed by soap molecule when they react with calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water
24220,"due to this, a lot of soap gets wasted and cleansing action gets reduced to a larger extent"
24221,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 10 science notes chapter 4 carbon and its compounds, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"

24234,"water: water + dissolved minerals like nitrogen, phosphorous etc., are taken up by the roots from the soil"
24235,how do raw materials for photosynthesis become available to the plant
24236,"water comes from the soil, through the xylem tissue in roots and stems"
24237,chloroplast contains chlorophyll (green pigment) main events of photosynthesis: absorption of light energy by chlorophyll
24238,conversion of light energy into chemical energy + splitting (breaking) of water into hydrogen and oxygen
24239,"sunlight activates chlorophyll, which leads to splitting of the water molecule"
24240,"the hydrogen, released by the splitting of a water molecule is utilized for the reduction of carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates"
24241,carbohydrate is subsequently converted into starch and is stored in leaves and other storage parts
24242,the splitting of water molecules is a part of the light reaction
24243,stomata – life processes class 10 notes stomata: these are tiny pores present in the epidermis of leaf or stem through which gaseous exchange and transpiration occur
24244,opening and closing of stomatal pores: the opening and closing of stomatal pores are controlled by the turgidity of guard cells
24245,"when guard cells uptake water from surrounding cells, they swell to become a turgid body, which enlarges the pore in between (stomatal opening)"
24246,"while, when water is released, they become flaccid shrinking to close the pore (stomatal closing)"
24247,significance of photosynthesis: photosynthesis is the main way through which solar energy is made available for different living beings
24248,green plants are the main producers of food in the ecosystem
24249,all other organisms directly or indirectly depend on green plants for food
24250,the process of photosynthesis also helps in maintaining the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air

24262,"assimilation: the process of utilization of digested food, for energy and for growth and repair is called assimilation"
24263,egestion: the process of removing undigested food from the body is called egestion
24264,amoeba is a unicellular animal which follows the holozoic mode of nutrition
24265,amoeba surrounds a food particle with pseudopodia and makes a food vacuole
24266,digestive enzymes are secreted in the food vacuole and digestion takes place
24267,"finally, the food vacuole moves near the cell membrane and undigested food is expelled out"
24268,"nutrition in human beings – life processes class 10 notes human beings are complex animals, which have a complex digestive system"
24269,the human digestive system is composed of an alimentary canal and some accessory glands
24270,"the alimentary canal is divided into several parts, like oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus"
24271,"salivary gland, liver and pancreas are the accessory glands which lie outside the alimentary canal"
24272,structure of the human digestive system: the human digestive system comprises of the alimentary canal and associated digestive glands
24273,"alimentary canal: it comprises of mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine"
24274,the tongue has gustatory receptors which perceive the sense of taste
24275,the tongue helps in turning over the food so that saliva can be properly mixed in it
24276,"teeth help in breaking down the food into smaller particles so that, swallowing of food becomes easier"
24277,the canine teeth are used for tearing the food and for cracking hard substances
24278,salivary glands secrete saliva: saliva makes the food slippery which makes it easy to swallow the food
24279,peristaltic movement: rhythmic contraction of muscles of the lining of the alimentary canal to push the food forward
24280,highly muscular walls of the stomach help in churning the food
24281,hydrochloric acid kills the germs which may be present in food
24282,"the enzyme pepsin, secreted in the stomach, does partial digestion of protein"
24283,"the mucus, secreted by the walls of the stomach saves the inner lining of the stomach from getting damaged from hydrochloric acid"
24284,the small intestine is longer than the large intestine but its lumen is smaller than that of the large intestine
24285,"the small intestine is divided into three parts, like duodenum, jejunum and ileum"
24286,"the liver manufactures bile, which gets stored in the gall bladder"
24287,"from the gall bladder, bile is released as and when required"
24288,bile and pancreatic juice go to the duodenum through a hepatopancreatic duct
24289,"after that, the enzyme lipase digests fat into fatty acids and glycerol"
24290,trypsin and chymotrypsin are enzymes which digest protein into amino acids
24291,"no digestion takes place in the jejunum: the inner wall in the ileum is projected into numerous finger-like structures, called villi"
24292,villi increase the surface area inside the ileum so that optimum absorption can take place
24293,"moreover, villi also reduce the lumen of the ileum so that food can stay for a longer duration in it, for optimum absorption"
24294,some water and salt are absorbed by the walls of the large intestine
24295,"after that, the undigested food goes to the rectum, from where it is expelled out through the anus"
24296,the rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus

24300,mitochondria is the site of respiration and the energy released is stored in the form of atp (adenosine triphosphate)
24301,atp is stored in mitochondria and is released as per need
24302,steps of respiration: breaking down of glucose into pyruvate: this step happens in the cytoplasm
24303,"glucose molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms, while pyruvic acid is composed of 3 carbon atoms"
24304,fate of pyruvic acid: further breaking down of pyruvic acid takes place in mitochondria and the molecules formed depend on the type of respiration in a particular organism
24305,respiration involves gaseous exchange: intake of oxygen from the atmosphere and release of co2 → breathing
24306,energy is released and water molecule is also formed at the end of this process
24307,anaerobic respiration: this type of respiration happens in the absence of oxygen
24308,pyruvic acid is either converted into ethyl alcohol or lactic acid
24309,"ethyl alcohol is usually formed in case of anaerobic respiration in microbes, like yeast or bacteria"
24310,lactic acid is formed in some microbes as well as in the muscle cells
24311,this happens because of anaerobic respiration taking place in the muscles
24312,this is compensated by anaerobic respiration and lactic acid is formed in the process
24313,the deposition of lactic acid causes pain in the leg muscles
24314,"exchange of gases: for aerobic respiration, organisms need a continuous supply of oxygen, and carbon dioxide produced during the process needs to be removed from the body"
24315,different organisms use different methods for the intake of oxygen and expulsion of carbon dioxide
24316,diffusion is the method which is utilized by unicellular and some simple organisms for this purpose
24317,"in complex animals, respiratory system does the job of exchange of gases"
24318,fishes take in oxygen which is dissolved in water through gills
24319,"since, availability of oxygen is less in the aquatic environment, so the breathing rate of aquatic organisms is faster"
24320,insects have a system of spiracles and trachease which is used for taking in oxygen
24321,availability of oxygen is not a problem in the terrestrial environment so breathing rate is slower as compared to what it is in fishes
24322,human respiratory system – life processes class 10 notes the human respiratory system is composed of a pair of lungs
24323,these are attached to a system of tubes which open on the outside through the nostrils
24324,following are the main structures in the human respiratory system: nostrils: there are two nostrils which converge to form a nasal passage
24325,the inner lining of the nostrils is lined by hair and remains wet due to mucus secretion

24378,"transpiration pull: loss of water vapour through stomata and lenticels, in plants, is called transpiration"
24379,"transpiration through stomata creates vacuum which creates a suction, called transpiration pull"
24380,"the transpiration pull sucks the water column from the xylem tubes and thus, water is able to rise to great heights in even the tallest plants"
24381,transport of food: transport of food in plants happens because of utilization of energy
24382,"thus, unlike the transport through xylem, it is a form of active transport"

24451,its curvature can be adjusted with the help of ciliary muscles
24452,pupil: it is a hole in the middle of iris through which light enters the eye
24453,it appears black because light falling on it goes into the eye and does not come back
24454,ciliary muscles: these are the muscles which are attached to eye lens and can modify the shape of eye lens which leads to the variation in focal lengths
24455,iris: it controls the amount of light entering the eye by changing the size of the pupil

24466,"for example, you would have observed that when you come out of the cinema hall after watching the movie in the bright sunlight, your eyes get closed"
24467,"and when you entered the hall from the bright light, you won’t be able to see and after some time you would be able to see"
24468,"here, the pupil of an eye provides a variable aperture, whose size is controlled by iris"
24469,"(a) when the light is bright: iris contracts the pupil, so that less light enters the eye"
24470,"(b) when the light is dim: iris expands the pupil, so that more light enters the eye"
24471,persistence of vision: it is the time for which the sensation of an object continue in the eye
24472,power of accommodation: the ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length accordingly as the distances is called power of accommodation
24473,colour blindness: a person having defective cone cells is not able to distinguish between the different colours
24474,defects of vision and their correction myopia (short-sightedness): it is a kind of defect in the human eye due to which a person can see near objects clearly but he cannot see the distant objects clearly
24475,"correction: since a concave lens has an ability to diverge incoming rays, it is used to correct this defect of vision"
24476,the image is allowed to format the retina by using a concave lens of suitable power as shown in the given figure
24477,"hypermetropia (long-sightedness): it is a kind of defect in the human eye due to which, a person can see distant objects properly but cannot see the nearby objects clearly"
24478,"it happens due to (i) decrease in the power of eye lens i.e., increase in focal length of eye lens"
24479,a hypermetropic eye has its least distance of distinct vision greater than 25 cm
24480,"correction: since a convex lens has the ability to converge incoming rays, it can be used to correct this defect of vision, as you already have seen in the animation"
24481,the ray diagram for the corrective measure for a hypermetropic eye is shown in the given figure
24482,"power of the correcting convex lens: the lens formula, \(\frac { 1 }{ v } -\frac { 1 }{ u } =\frac { 1 }{ f }\) can be used to calculate the focal length and hence, the power of the myopia correcting lens"
24483,"in this case, object distance, u = ∞ image distance, v = person’s far point focal length, f ="
24484,"hence, lens formula becomes in case of a concave lens, the image is formed in front of the lens i.e., on the same side of the object"
24485,"focal length = -far point now, power of the required lens (p) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f(in m) }\) power of the correcting convex lens: lens formula, \(\frac { 1 }{ v } -\frac { 1 }{ u } =\frac { 1 }{ f }\) can be used to calculate focal length f and hence, power p of the correcting convex lens, where, object distance, u = -25 cm, normal near point image distance, v = defective near point hence, the lens formula is reduced to \(\frac { 1 }{ v } +\frac { 1 }{ 25 } =\frac { 1 }{ f }\) presbyopia: it is a kind of defect in human eye which occurs due to ageing"
24486,it happens due to the following reasons (i) decrease in flexibility of eye lens
24487,"in this, a person may suffer from both myopia and hypermetropia"
24488,"bifocal lenses consist of both concave and convex lens, upper position consists of the concave lens and lower portion consists of a convex lens"
24489,astigmatism: it is a kind of defect in human eye due to which a person cannot see (focus) simultaneously horizontal and vertical lines both
24490,"cataract: due to the membrane growth over eye lens, the eye lens becomes hazy or even opaque"
24491,"refraction of light through a prism, dispersion of white light by a glass prism, composition of white light, recombination of spectrum colours, rainbow"
24492,"refraction of light through a prism: when a ray of light is incident on a rectangular glass slab, after refracting through the slab, it gets displaced laterally"
24493,"as a result, the emergent ray comes out parallel to the incident ray"
24494,"unlike a rectangular slab, the side of a glass prism are inclined at an angle called the angle of prism"
24495,prism: a prism has two triangular bases and three angle of prism: angle between two lateral faces is angle of deviation: the angle between the incident deviation
24496,dispersion of white light by a glass prism: the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its seven constituent colours when it passes through a glass prism is called dispersion of white light
24497,"the various colours seen are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red"
24498,the different component colour of light bends at a different angle with respect to the incident angle
24499,the violet light bends the least while the red bends most
24500,"composition of white light: white light consists of seven colours i.e., violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red"
24501,"monochromatic light: light consisting of single colour or wavelength is called monochromatic light, example; sodium light"
24502,"polychromatic light: light consisting of more than two colours or wavelengths is called polychromatic light, example; white light"
24503,"recombination of white light: newton found that when an inverted prism is placed in the path of dispersed light then after passing through the prism, they recombine to form white light"
24504,"issac newton: he was the first, who obtained spectrum of sunlight by using glass prism"
24505,"he tried to split the spectrum of white light more by using another similar prism, but he could not get any more colours"
24506,he repeated the experiment using second prism in inverted position with respect to the first prism
24507,it allowed all the colours of spectrum to pass through second prism
24508,he found white light emerges on the other side of second prism
24509,he concluded that sun is made up of seven visible colour vibgyor
24510,"it is formed due to the dispersion of sunlight by the tiny water droplet, present in the atmosphere"
24511,formation of the rainbow: the water droplets act like small prism
24512,"they refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop"
24513,"due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye"
24514,red colour appears on top and violet at the bottom of rainbow
24515,a rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of sun
24516,atmospheric refraction: the refraction of light caused by the earth’s atmosphere (having air layers of varying optical densities) is called atmospheric refraction
24517,appearance of star position: it is due to atmospheric refraction of star light
24518,the temperature and density of different layer of atmosphere keeps varying
24519,"when the starlight enter the earth’s atmosphere, it undergoes refraction continuously, due to changing refractive index i.e"
24520,"due to this, the apparent position of the star is different from actual position"
24521,"as the beam of starlight keeps deviating from its path, the apparent position of star keeps on changing because physical condition of earth’s atmosphere is not stationary"
24522,"hence, the amount of light enters our eyes fluctuate sometimes bright and sometime dim"
24523,planets are closer to earth and are seen as extended source of light i.e
24524,the collection of large number of point sized sources of light
24525,therefore the total amount of light entering our eyes from all individual point source will nullify the twinkling effect
24526,"why, the duration of day becomes approximately 4 minutes shorter if there is no atmosphere on earth: actual sun rise happens when it is below the horizon in the morning"
24527,the rays of light from the sun below the horizon reach our eyes because of refraction of light
24528,"similarly, the sun can be seen about few minutes after the actual sun set"
24529,"thus the duration of, day time will increase by 4 minutes"
24530,because of this sun is visible about 2 minutes earlier than actual sunrise and about 2 minutes after the actual sun set
24531,apparent flattering of the sun’s disc at sunset and sunrise is due to atmospheric refraction
24532,"scattering of light: according to rayleigh’ law of scattering, the amount of scattered light ∝ \(\frac { 1 }{ { \lambda }^{ 4 } }\) (λ = wavelength) scattering of light decreases with increase in wavelength"
24533,"tyndall effect: when a beam of light strikes, the minute particle of earth’s atmosphere, suspended particles of dust and molecule of air the path of beam become visible"
24534,the phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particle gives rise to tyndall effect
24535,it can be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest
24536,the colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles
24537,"colour of sunrise and sunset: while sunset and sunrise, the colour of the sun and its surroundihg appear red"
24538,"during sunset and sunrise, the sun is near to horizon, and therefore, the sunlight has to travel larger distance in atmosphere"
24539,"due to this, most of the blue light (shorter wavelength) is scattered away by the particles"
24540,why the danger signal or sign is made of red colour
24541,red colour scatteres the most when strikes the small particle of fog and smoke because it has the maximum wavelength (visible spectrum)
24542,"hence, from large distance also, we can see the red colour clearly"
24543,"at noon sun appears white: at noon, the sun is overhead and sunlight would travel shorter distance relatively through the atmosphere"
24544,"hence, at noon, the sun appear white as only little of the blue and violet colours are scattered"
24545,human eye: it is a wonderful gift of nature to the human body
24546,human eye is nearly spherical in shape of diameter about 2.5 cm
24547,parts of human eye: cornea: it is the protective and front layer of the eye
24548,it regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the iris
24549,ciliary muscles: it holds the eye lens at its proper position
24550,eye lens: the eye lens is a convex lens made by the transparent jelly like material
24551,rods and cones: these are colour sensitive rods and cones shaped cells
24552,rods are responsible for the vision in dim light while cones are responsible for colour
24553,optic nerve: it converts information of the image into a corresponding electric signal and passes it to the brain
24554,"blind spot: the junction of the optic nerve and retina, where no rods and cones cells are present is called the blind spot"
24555,near point: the nearest point from eye at which the eye can see clearly without strain is called near point
24556,"far point: the farthest point, upto which the eye can see the object clearly is called far point"
24557,the range of vision: distance between near point and far point of eye is called range of vision
24558,power of accommodation: the ability of the eye to see near as well as far objects clearly is called power of accommodation
24559,"myopia (nearsightedness): in this defect, the eye is unable to see far off objects clearly but is able to see near objects clearly"
24560,due to increase in size of eye ball due to excessive curvature of cornea due to increase in power (or decrease in focal length) of eye lens
24561,correction: it is corrected by using concave lens of suitable focal length
24562,hypermetropia (far sightedness): in this defect eye is unable to see nearby objects clearly but is able to see far objects clearly
24563,due to decrease in size of eye ball due to decrease in power (or increase in focal length) of eye lens
24564,correction: it is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable focal length
24565,dispersion of light: splitting of white light into seven colours is called dispersion
24566,the human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs
24567,it enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us
24568,the eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm
24569,most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea
24570,the crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus
24571,the human eye has the following parts : cornea : the transparent spherical membrane covering the front of the eye
24572,eye lens : it is a transparent lens made of jelly like material
24573,blind spot: the point at which the optic nerve leaves the eye
24574,an image formed at this point is not sent to the brain
24575,aqueous humour: a clear liquid region between the cornea and the lens
24576,vitreous humour: the space between eye lens and retina is filled with another liquid called vitreous humour
24577,"in the eye, the image is formed on the retina by successive refractions at the cornea, the aqueous humour, the lens and the vitreous humour"
24578,electrical signals then travel along the optic nerve to the brain to be interpreted
24579,"in good light, the yellow spot is most sensitive to detail and the image is automatically formed there"
24580,"accommodation: the ability of the eye to focus both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal length, is called the accommodation of the eye or the ability of the ciliary muscles to change the focal length of the eye lens is called accommodation"
24581,"defects of the eye : although the eye is one of the most remarkable organs in the body, it may have several abnormalities, which can often be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery"
24582,"the various defects from which an eye can suffer are (i) hypermetropia or long sightedness, (ii) myopia or shortsightedness and (iii) astigmatism, (iv) presbyopia"
24583,"hypermetropia, hyperopia, or long sightedness : a person suffering from this defect can see distant objects i clearly but cannot see nearby objects clearly"
24584,"in this defect, the near point lies farther away than 25 cm"
24585,hypermetropia (far sightedness — the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond the retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power
24586,hypermetropia is due to the following reasons : either the hyperopic eyeball is too short or the ciliary muscle is unable to change the shape of the lens enough to properly focus the image i.e
24587,myopia or short sightedness or near sightedness: a person suffering frommyopia or short sightedness can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see the far away objects clearly
24588,myopia (short sightedness — the image of distant objects is focussed before the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power
24589,this defect is due to the following reasons : either the eyeball is longer than normal or the maximum focal length (due to excessive curvature of the cornea) of the lens is insufficient to produce a clearly formed image on the retina
24590,"a person may also have an eye defect known as astigmatism, in which light from a point-source produces a line image on the retina"
24591,"a person suffering from this defect cannot see in all directions equally well i.e., he cannot see the vertical and horizontal lines simultaneously"
24592,this condition arises either when the cornea or the crystalline lens or both are not perfectly spherical
24593,"astigmatism can be corrected with lenses having different curvatures in two mutually perpendicular directions i.e., cylindrical lens"
24594,"when a person suffers from both, the myopia as well as hypermetropia, his spectacles for correction have bifocal lenses"
24595,the upper half is a concave lens for distant vision and lower half is a convex lens for reading
24596,"presbyopia is that defect of human eye, due to which an old person cannot read and write comfortably"
24597,"to correct presbyopia, an old person has to use spectacles with a convex lens of suitable focal length, or power as explained already"
24598,the cause of hypermetropia is decrease in length of eyeball or increase in focal length of eye lens
24599,but the cause of presbyopia is only increase in focal length of eye lens
24600,"the vision of the eye decreases, leading sometimes to total loss of vision"
24601,"the problem is overcome by cataract surgery i.e., removal of the eye lens, and its replacement by a lens of suitable focal length"
24602,we need two eyes because a human being has a horizontal field of view of about 150° with one eye and of about 180° with two eyes
24603,"with one eye, the world looks flat, i.e., two dimensional only"
24604,"with two eyes, the view is three dimensional, i.e., dimension of depth is added to our view"
24605,"as our two eyes are separated by a few centimetres, each eye observes a slightly different image"
24606,our brain combines the two views into one and we get to know how close or far away the things seen are
24607,"by donating our eyes after we die, one pair of our eyes can give vision to two corneal blind people"
24608,eye donors may belong to any sex or any age group
24609,"people suffering from diabetes, hypertension, asthma or any other non- communicable diseases can donate eyes"
24610,people who have been using spectacles or those operated for cataract can also donate eyes
24611,"the smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision"
24612,"for a young adult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm"
24613,"persistence of vision of the eye: the image of an object persists on the retina for 1/16 second, even after the removal of the object"
24614,the sequence of still pictures taken by a movie camera is projected on a screen at a rate of about 24 images or more per second
24615,the successive impressions of images on the screen appear to merge smoothly into one another to give us the feeling of moving images
24616,"the large numbers of light sensitive cells contained in the retina of the eye are of two types: rod shaped cells which respond to brightness or intensity of light and cone shaped cells, which respond to colour of light"
24617,"when a person cannot distinguish between different colours, he is said to be colour blind though his vision may otherwise be normal"
24618,farpoint: the farthest point upto which a short sighted eye can see clearly is called the far point of the eye
24619,near point : the nearest point upto which a long sighted eye can see clearly is called the near point of the eye
24620,"for a normal human eye, of an adult, the near point is about 25 cm from the eye"
24621,least cfistance of distinct vision: the minimum distance upto which an eye can see clearly is called the legist distance of distinct vision ; it is normally denoted by d
24622,the least distance of distinct vision is equal to the distance between the eye and its near point
24623,"for a normal human eye, this distance is around 25 cm"
24624,the distance between far point and near point of the eye is called range of vision of the eye
24625,"when white light passes through a prism, the violet light bends most and the red light bends the least"
24626,dispersion of light is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours on passing through a glass prism
24627,the band of seven colours so obtained is called visible spectrum
24628,"the seven colours of white light are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red"
24629,isaac newton was the first to use a prism to obtain a spectrum of sunlight
24630,spectrum is the band of distinct colours we obtain when white light is split by a prism
24631,cause of dispersion : every colour has its own characteristic wavelength/frequency
24632,"therefore, refractive index of the medium for different colours is different"
24633,"as a result, different colours undergo different deviations on passing through the prism"
24634,"the speed of light in vacuum is same for all wavelengths, but the speed in a material substance is different for different wavelengths"
24635,in any medium other than air/vacuum red light travels the fastest and violet light travels the slowest
24636,the most familiar form of electromagnetic radiation may be defined as that part of the spectrum that the human eye can detect
24637,light is produced by the rearrangement of electrons in atoms and molecules
24638,the various wavelengths of visible light are classified with colours ranging from violet (λ = 4 x 10-7 m) to red (λ = 7 x 10-7 m)
24639,"the eye’s sensitivity is a function of wavelength, the sensitivity being a maximum at a wavelength of about λ = 5.6 x 10-7 m (yellow-green)"
24640,when we pass white light through two ideptical prisms held side by side with their refracting edges in opposite directions; the first prism disperses white light into seven colours and the second prism recombines the seven colours into white light
24641,a rainbow is formed due to dispersion of light by tiny droplets of water which act as prisms
24642,"atmospheric refraction is the cause of twinkling of stars, advance sunrise and delayed sunset"
24643,scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky and the reddening of the sun at sunrise and sunset
24644,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 10 science notes chapter 11 human eye and colourful world, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
24645,functions: the main functions are hearing and balance of the body
24646,"functions: these receptors are responsible for pain, touch and heat stimuli"
24647,"nervous system: the nervous system is composed of specialized tissues, called nervous tissue"
24648,the nerve cell or neuron is the functional unit of the nervous system
24649,it is the nervous system which is mainly responsible for control and coordination in complex animals
24650,functions of the nervous system nervous system receives information from the environment
24651,a neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system
24652,neuron: neuron is a highly specialized cell which is responsible for the transmission of nerve impulses
24653,"the neuron consists of the following parts (i) cyton or cell body: the cell body or cyton is somewhat star-shaped, with many hair like structures protruding out of the margin"
24654,(iii) myelin sheath: there is an insulator cover around the axon
24655,the myelin sheath insulates the axon against nerve impulse from the surroundings
24656,types of neuron sensory neuron: these neurons receive signals from a sense organ
24657,motor neuron: these neurons send signals to a muscle or a gland
24658,association or relay neuron: these neurons relay the signals between sensory neuron and motor neuron
24659,synapse: the point contact between the terminal branches of axon of one neuron with the dendrite of another neuron is called synapse
24660,neuromuscular junction (nmj): nmj is the point where a muscle fibre comes in contact with a motor neuron carrying nerve impulse from the control nervous system
24661,transmission of nerve impulse: nerve impulses travel in the following manner from one neutron to the next : dendrites → cell body → axon → nerve endings at the tip of axon → synapse → dendrite of next neuron
24662,"chemical released from axon tip of one neuron, cross the synapse or neuromuscular junction to reach the next cell"
24663,human nervous system: the nervous system in humans can be divided into three main parts 1
24664,central nervous system: the central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord
24665,the spinal cord works as the relay channel for signals between the brain and the peripheral nervous system
24666,peripheral nervous system: the peripheral nervous system is composed of the cranial nerves and spinal nerves
24667,the cranial nerves come our of the brain and go to the organs in the head region
24668,the spinal nerves come out of the spinal cord and go to the organs which are below the head region
24669,autonomous nervous system: the autonomous nervous system is composed of a chain of nerve ganglion which runs along the spinal cord
24670,the autonomous nervous system can be divided into two parts : sympathetic nervous system
24671,sympathetic nervous system: this part of the autonomous nervous system heightens the activity of an organ as per the need
24672,"for example, during running, there is an increased demand for oxygen by the body"
24673,this is fulfilled by an increased breathing rate and increased heart rate
24674,"the sympathetic nervous system works to increase the breathing rate the heart rate, in this case"
24675,parasympathetic nervous system: this part of the autonomous nervous system slows the down the activity of an organ and thus has a calming effect
24676,"during sleep, the breathing rate slows down and so does the heart rate"
24677,it can be said that the parasympathetic nervous system helps in the conservation of energy
24678,"human brain: human brain is a highly complex organ, which is mainly composed of nervous tissue"
24679,the tissues are highly folded to accommodate a large surface area in less space
24680,"the brain is covered by a three-layered system of membranes, called meninges"
24681,parts of human brain : fore-brain: it is composed of the cerebrum
24682,some main structures of the human brain are explained below : cerebrum: the cerebrum is the largest part in the human brains
24683,"it is the site of sensory perceptions, like tactile and auditory perceptions"
24684,it controls sleep and wake cycle (circadian rhythm) of the body
24685,cerebellum: cerebellum lies below the cerebrum and at the back of the whole structure
24686,"when you are riding your bicycle, the perfect coordination between your pedalling and steering control is achieved by the cerebellum"
24687,it lies at the base of the brain and continues into the spinal cord
24688,"the medulla controls various involuntary functions, like hear beat respiration, etc"
24689,"pons: it relays impulses between the lower cerebellum and spinal cord, and higher parts of the brain like the cerebrum and midbrain, also regulates respiration"
24690,spinal cord: spinal cord controls the reflex actions and conducts massages between different parts of the body and brain
24691,reflex action: reflex action is a special case of involuntary movement involuntary organs
24692,"when a voluntary organ is in the vicinity of sudden danger, it is immediately pulled away from the danger to save itself"
24693,"for example, when your hand touches a very hot electric iron, you move away your hand in a jerk"
24694,all of this happens in flash and your hand is saved from the imminent injury
24695,"reflex arc: the path through which nerves signals, involved in a reflex action, travel is called the reflex arc"
24696,the following flow chart shows the flow of signal in a reflex arc
24697,receptor → sensory neuron → relay neuron → motor neuron → effector (muscle) the receptor is the organ which comes in the danger zone
24698,the sensory neurons pick signals from the receptor and send them to the relay neuron
24699,the spinal cord sends signals to the effector via the motor neuron
24700,"the effector comes in action, moves the receptor away from the danger"
24701,the reflex arc passes at the level of the spinal cord and the signals involved in reflex action do not travel up to the brain
24702,this is important because sending signals to the brain would involve more time
24703,"although every action is ultimately controlled by the brain, the reflex action is mainly controlled at the level of spinal cord"
24704,protection of brain and spinal cord brain is protected by a fluid filled balloon which acts as shocks absorber and enclosed in cranium (brain box) spinal chord is enclosed in vertebral column
24705,"muscular movements and nervous control: muscle tissues have special filaments, called actin and myosin"
24706,"when a muscle receives a nerve signal, a series of events is triggered in the muscle"
24707,it result in actin and myosin filaments sliding towards each other and that is how a muscle contracts
24708,endocrine system: the endocrine system is composed of several endocrine glands
24709,nervous do not react to every nook and corner of the body and hence hormones are needed to affect control and coordination in those parts
24710,hormones: these are the chemical messengers secreted in very small amounts by specialised tissues called ductless glands
24711,endocrine system helps in control and coordination through chemical compounds called hormones
24712,endocrine gland: a ductless gland that secretes hormones directly into the bloodstream
24713,thyroid gland neck thyroxine controls general metabolism and growth in the body
24714,adrenal gland above kidneys adrenalin prepares the body for emergency situations and hence is also called ‘fight and flight’ hormone
24715,"ovary (female) near uterus oestrogen egg production, development of secondary sexual characters during puberty"
24716,"iodised salt is necessary because: iodine mineral is essential part of thyronine hormone so it is important that we must consume iodised salt as in turn it is essential for thyroid gland as it controls carbohydrate, proteins and fat metabolism for best balance of growth deficiency of iodine might cause disease called goitre"
24717,diabetes: cause : it is due to deficiency of insulin hormone secreted by pancreas that is responsible to lower/control the blood sugar levels
24718,treatment : patients have to internally administer injections of insulin hormone which helps in regulating blood-sugar level
24719,"in case of flight or fight reaction to an emergency situation, adrenal glands → release adrenaline into blood → which acts on heart and other tissues → causes faster heart beat → more oxygen to muscles → reduced blood supply to digestive system and skin → diversion of blood to skeletal muscles → increase in breathing rate"
24720,feedback mechanism: a type of self-regulating mechanism in which the level of one substance in body influences the level of another
24721,control and co-ordination in plants: movements in plants and plant harmones
24722,"co-ordination in plants: unlike animals, plants do not have a nervous system"
24723,many plant hormones are responsible for various kinds of movements in plants
24724,movements in plants can be divided into two main types : tropic movement nastic movement 1
24725,tropic movement: the movements which are in a particular direction in relation to the stimulus are called tropic movements
24726,tropic movements happen as a result of growth of a plant part in a particular direction
24727,(i) geotropic movement: the growth in a plant part in response to the gravity is called geotropic movement
24728,(ii) phototropic movement: the growth in a plant part in response to light is called phototropic movement
24729,"stems usually show positive phototropic movement, while roots usually show negative phototropic movement"
24730,if a plant is kept in a container in which no sunlight reaches and a hole in the container allows some sunlight; the stem finally grows in the direction of the sunlight
24731,this happens because of a higher rate of cell division in the part of stem which is away from the sunlight
24732,the heightened rate of cell division is attained by increased secretion of the plant hormone auxin in the which is away from sunlight
24733,"(iii) hydrotropic movement: when roots grow in the soil, they usually grow towards the nearest source of water"
24734,(iv) thigmotropism movement: the growth in a plant part in response to touch is called thigmotropism movement
24735,the tendril grows in a way so as it can coil around a support
24736,the differential rate of cell division in different parts of the tendril happens due to action of auxin
24737,nastic movement: the movement which do not depend on the direction from the stimulus acts are called nastic movement
24738,"for example, when someone touches the leaves of mimosa, the leaves droop"
24739,the drooping is independent of the direction from which the leaves are touched
24740,such movements usually happen because of changing water balance in the cells
24741,"when leaves of mimosa are touched, the cells in the leaves lose- water and become flaccid, resulting in drooping of leaves"
24742,"plant hormones: plant hormones are chemical which help to co-ordinate growth, development and responses to the environment"
24743,type of plant hormones: main plant hormones are auxin: (synthesized at shoot tip)
24744,(stress hormone) control and coordination in plants stimuli: the change in the environment to which an organism responds
24745,co-ordination: working together of various organs of an organism in a systematic manner to produce a proper response
24746,auxin: it is a plant hormone which promotes cell enlargement and growth in plants
24747,gibberellins: a plant hormone which promotes cell differentiation and breaking dormancy of seeds and buds
24748,cytokinin: a plant hormone which promotes cell division and the opening of stomata
24749,abscisic acid: it helps in inhibiting the growth of the plant and promotes wilting and falling of leaves and food
24750,tropism: a growth movement of a plant which determines direction with the stimulus
24751,nastism: a growth movement of a plant which does not determine direction with a stimulus
24752,thigmotropism: movement of plants towards a response to the touch of an object
24753,control and coordination in animals stimuli: the change in the environment to which the organism responds
24754,co-ordination: working together of various organs of an organism in a systematic manner to produce a proper response
24755,receptor: a cell in a sense organ which is sensitive to stimuli
24756,motor nerves: it carries the message from the brain to body parts for action
24757,reflex action: sudden movement or response to the stimulus which occurs in a very short duration of time and does not involve any will or thinking of the brain
24758,brain: an organ present in the skull which controls and regulates the activity of the whole body and is known as president of the body
24759,cerebrum: main thinking part of brain present in the forebrain area which controls all voluntary actions
24760,cerebellum: it is present in the hindbrain area and helps in maintaining posture and balance of the body
24761,medulla: it is present in the hindbrain area and helps in controlling voluntary actions of the brain
24762,spinal cord: it is a cylindrical structure of nerve fibres enclosed in the vertebral column which helps in the conduction of nerve impulses to and from the brain
24763,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 10 science notes chapter 7 control and coordination, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
24764,the young ones formed are almost identical to each other as well as to the parent cell
24765,asexual reproduction generally occurs during favourable environmental conditions and when there is an abundance of food
24766,"types of asexual reproduction is unicellular organism (i) binary fission: seen in bacteria, protozoa like amoeba, paramecium"
24767,(in these first pseudopodia withdrawn (karyokinesis) the nucleus of the parent cell divides and then the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis) resulting in the formation of two daughter cells)
24768,the cell division can occur in any plane as in case of amoeba
24769,"(cause kala-azar), which have a whip like flagella at one end, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to the flagellum"
24770,"in this during unfavourable conditions, the parent cell develops a thick resistant wall around itself forming a cyst"
24771,"within the wall, the cytoplasm divides many times to form many plasmodia"
24772,"when conditions become favourable, the cyst wall breaks and the plasmodium are released"
24773,the parent yeast cell develops a protrusion or an outgrowth at its upper end
24774,the nucleus of the parent cell divides and one of them moves into the outgrowth which grows bigger and finally separates from the parent cell to lead an independent existence
24775,"very often if the conditions are highly favourable, a chain of buds is formed"
24776,types of asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms : (i) fragmentation: seen in multicellular organisms which have a relatively simple body organisation like spirogyra
24777,"however, all multicellular organisms cannot show cell-by-cell division as cells from tissues which form organs"
24778,(ii) regeneration: it is the ability of organisms to develop their lost parts
24779,some organisms show have high regenerative capacity it is also a means of reproduction for example; planaria
24780,(regeneration is carried out by specialized cells which redivide to form a mass of cells from which different cells undergo changes to become different cell types and tissues
24781,this grows in size and finally breaks off to live independently
24782,the erect hyphae bear sporangia inside which reproductive structures called spores are formed
24783,they are produced during unfavourable times and help to tide over the unfavourable environmental conditions
24784,"when the spores fall on a suitable medium, each one forms a new individual"
24785,"(v) vegetative propagation: method by which plants reproduce by their vegetative parts such as roots, stems, and leaves"
24786,types of vegetative propagation: it is two types natural vegetative propagation
24787,"in biyophyllum buds are produced in the notches along the leaf margins and when they fall on the soil, they develop into new plants"
24788,importance of vegetative propagation plants can bear flowers and fruits earlier
24789,plants which have lost the ability to produce viable seeds can also reproduce by vegetative propagation
24790,"the property of vegetative propagation is used by horticulturists in developing methods like layering, grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes"
24791,tissue culture: the technique of developing new plants from a cell or tissue in a nutrient medium under aseptic conditions
24792,the cell or tissue is placed in a nutrient medium where it forms a mass of cells called callus
24793,this callus is then transferred to another nutrient medium where it differentiates and forms a new plant
24794,"sexual reproduction: sexual reproduction in plants, sexual reproduction in human beings"
24795,the mode of reproduction that takes place with the involvement of two individuals of two different sexes i.e
24796,"during sexual reproduction, male organism having male sex organs produces male gametes i.e"
24797,sperms which are small and motile and the female organism having female sex organs produces ova which are generally large and store food
24798,male and female gametes fuse to form a zygote that grows into a new organism
24799,significance of sexual reproduction : sexual reproduction involves dna as well as cellular apparatus of two different organisms which promotes diversity of characters in the offspring
24800,"since gametes are derived from two different organisms, it results in a new combination of genes which increases the chances of genetic variations"
24801,sexual reproduction involves division in the sex organs that reduces the dna matter to half so that the zygote formed after fusion has the same amount of dna as the parents it maintains dna in a species
24802,limitation of sexual reproduction: sexual reproduction involves the process of combining dna from two different organisms which may bring some undesirable features also
24803,sexual reproduction in flowering plants the reproductive parts are present in the flower
24804,"the parts of the flower are sepals, petals, stamens and carpels"
24805,sepals are green structures that protect the inner parts when the flower is in bud stage
24806,stamens are male reproductive parts and produce pollen grains that contain male gametes
24807,the carpel is the female reproductive part and produces ovules that contain female gametes
24808,it has three parts—stigma which is top sticky part and receives pollen grains during pollination
24809,style which is the middle long part and ovary which is the swollen part and contains ovules
24810,having both stamens and carpels for example; mustard china rose (hibiscus)
24811,pollination: the process of transfer of pollen grains from an anther to the stigma of the flower is pollination
24812,two types of pollination are: (i) self-pollination: the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant
24813,(ii) cross-pollination: the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of another flower or another flower of a different plant of the same species
24814,"it generally takes place with the help of some agents like insects, birds, wind and water"
24815,fertilization: fertilization is the process of fusion of male and female gamete to form a zygote during sexual reproduction
24816,the events are pollen grains land on the stigma of the ovary
24817,"pollen tubes grow out of the pollen grains, travel through the style and reach the ovary, through micro pyle"
24818,each ovule has two polar nuclei and a female germ cell (egg)
24819,"pollen tube releases two male germ cells inside the ovule, one of them fuses with female germ cell and forms a zygote which grows into the baby plant i.e"
24820,"the other male germ cell fuses with two polar nuclei, the process is known as triple fusion"
24821,post-fertilisation changes: after fertilisation the following changes takes place in the flower
24822,zygote divides several times and forms an embryo inside the ovule
24823,the ovule develops a tough coat and changes into the seed
24824,seed and its parts: the advantage of seed is that it protects the future plant i.e
24825,seed has two parts: cotyledons and embryo cotyledons store food for the future plant
24826,the process of development of a seedling from the embryo under appropriate conditions is known as germination
24827,"ovum is bigger, non-motile and only one ovary produces one ovum in one month"
24828,there is no food stored in the sperms whereas ova contain stored food
24829,both the gametes are microscopic unicellular and have half the number of chromosomes as compared to the body cells
24830,puberty is the period during adolescence when the rate of general body growth begins to slow down and reproductive tissues begin to mature
24831,"onset of puberty in human males is between 11 to 13 yrs of age, while in human females is between 10 to 12 yrs"
24832,"puberty is associated with many physical, mental, emotional and psychological changes in boys and girls which occur slowly over a period of time"
24833,for instance thick dark hair start growing in new parts of the body such as arm pits and genital area between the thighs
24834,"individuals become more conscious of their bodies become more independent, more aggressive etc"
24835,"in case of boys beard and mustache start appearing, voice begins to crack, reproductive organs develop and start producing releasing sperms"
24836,"in case of girls, breast size begins to increase, skin of the nipples darkens, menstruation starts"
24837,the act of mating between the male and female partner is termed as copulation
24838,"one pair of testes are present in a bag-like structure called scrotum which lies outside the abdominal cavity, hence they are extra abdominal in position"
24839,this is so because the testes have to be maintained at 1-3 degree lesser temperature than the body in order to produce functional sperms
24840,to produce a male reproductive hormone called testosterone which is responsible for producing sperms as well as secondary sexual characteristics in males
24841,attached to each testis is a highly coiled tube called epididymis
24842,the sperms are stored here and they mature in the epididymis
24843,it unites with the duct coming from the urinary bladder to form a common duct called urethra which passes through the penis and opens to the outside
24844,along the way the ducts of the three glands also open and pour their secretions into the vas deferens
24845,function of the vas-deferens: it is meant for the passage of the sperms in the male body
24846,functions of the glands: they produce different secretions which provide nutrition as well as medium for locomotion to the sperms
24847,the secretions of the three glands along with the sperms is known as semen
24848,function of the urethra: it is the common passage for both semen and urine from the body to
24849,penis: it is the organ which is used to introduce semen into the female body
24850,each ovary is almond shaped and present inside the abdominal cavity
24851,at the time of birth each girl child already contains thousands of immature ova
24852,only one ovum is produced by one ovary in one month and each ovary releases an ovum in alternate months
24853,the release of an ovum from the ovary into the abdominal cavity is known as ovulation
24854,functions of ovary to produce and release ova to produce female reproductive hormones: estrogen and progesterone
24855,the end lying close to the ovary has finger like structures called fimbriae
24856,the two fallopian tubes unite to form an elastic bag like structure called uterus
24857,function of the fallopian tubes: it is the site of fertilization between the male and the female gametes and formation of the zygote early embryo
24858,the inner lining of the uterus is richly supplied with blood vessels and is known as endometrium
24859,function of the uterus: the embryo formed in the fallopian tube comes down and gets attached to the endometrium (implantation) and develops for the next nine months till the baby is delivered
24860,the vagina is a muscular tube through which the baby is delivered at the end of nine months
24861,it also serves as the canal for receiving the semen at the time of copulation
24862,the sperms travel upwards and reach the fallopian tube where one sperm fuses with the ovum to form the zygote
24863,the zygote divides and redivides as it descends into the uterus and the embryo gets implanted in the endometrium
24864,"the embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta, which is a disk-like structure embeded in the uterine wall"
24865,"it contains finger-like villi on the embryo side, while on the mother’s side blood spaces surround the villi"
24866,villi provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the developing embryo and the wastes to pass from the embryo to the mother through the placenta
24867,"when the embryo starts resembling a human is formed, it is termed as a foetus"
24868,the foetus continues to develop inside the uterus for almost nine months after which the baby is delivered as a result of rhythmic contractions of the uterine muscles
24869,"menstruation: it is the loss of blood, mucous along with the unfertilized ovum and the ruptured cells and tissues of the endometrium through the vagina of the female"
24870,it is a 28-day cycle which occurs in every reproductively active female (from puberty)
24871,"if the ovum does not get fertilized, then the endometrium starts sloughing off and there is loss of blood and mucous etc"
24872,"in case the ovum gets fertilized, then the endometrium becomes thick and spongy for nourishing the embryo and hence menstruation does not occur"
24873,a lady with a developing embryo in her womb is termed as pregnant
24874,the stopage of menstruation when the woman is 45-55 yrs of age is called menopause
24875,a number of diseases occur as a result of sexual intercourse if one of the partners is infected
24876,"they can be caused by bacteria for example; syphilis, gonorrhoea; or caused by a virus for example; hiv-aids, warts etc"
24877,the transmission of these diseases can be avoided by using birth control measures such as wearing a condom during the sexual act
24878,mechanical methods: these are used to prevent the passage of semen to the follopian tube : (i) use of condoms: condoms are thin rubber tubes worn over the penis before sexual intercourse
24879,the semen gets collected in this and is not discharged into the vagina
24880,(ii) diaphragm: it is a thin rubber fixed over a flexible metal ring which is fitted over the cervix in a woman’s body by a doctor
24881,(iii) intra uterine contraceptive device (iucd) or loop: it is inserted in the uterus and its insertion causes certain secretion which prevents the implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall
24882,"chemical methods use of spermicides: these are strong sperm-killing chemicals available in the form of creams, jellies etc"
24883,oral contraceptive pills: these are hormonal pills which prevent ovulation but do not stop menstruation
24884,surgical methods vasectomy: it involves cutting and ligating the vas deferens in males
24885,tubectomy: it involves cutting and ligating reproductive organs the fallopian tubes in females
24886,medical termination of pregnancy (mtp) or abortions is carried out to eliminate the developing embryo
24887,"this practice can, however, be misused to carry out female foeticide which involves the killing of the female foetus"
24888,it should be avoided at all cost as it disturbs the male-female ratio in a population
24889,reproduction: it is the process by which living organisms produce new individuals similar to themselves
24890,it involves a continuation of characters from the parents to daughter cells by copying of dna (deoxyribose nucleic acid) molecules present in the chromosomes of the cell
24891,"copying of dnas is also not a foolproof exercise, even minute changes bring about variation in the blue print of the offsprings"
24892,the useful variations are retained while the harmful ones do not go beyond
24893,"actually, variations help the species to withstand drastic environmental changes, thus save the species from becoming extinct and promotes its survival for a longer time"
24894,asexual reproduction: it is extremely useful as a means of rapid multiplication
24895,different forms of asexual reproduction: fission: the parent cell divides/splits into two daughter cells —binary fission and splits into many cells —multiple fission
24896,budding: a new organism is produced as an outgrowth of the parent body part
24897,"spore formation: spores are small, the bulb-like structure which develops at the top of the erect hyphae of the fungus-plant, when released into the air germinate, into new individuals after landing into food or soil"
24898,fragmentation: it is the accidental process when the broken pieces of an organism (fragments) grows into a complete organism
24899,"regeneration: when simple animals like a hydra, planaria develop a new individual from their broken older part it is known as regeneration"
24900,it is carried out by specialised cells which grow large numbers of cells
24901,"vegetative propagation: a mode of reproduction in which parts like the stem, root, leaves develop into new plants under favourable conditions"
24902,"benefits: plants can bear flowers, fruits more quickly than those produced from seeds"
24903,"growing banana, orange, rose, jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds"
24904,"sexual reproduction: when reproduction takes place as a result of the fusion between two gametes, one from each parent, it is called sexual reproduction"
24905,the formation of gametes involves an exchange of chromosomal (genetic) fragments between homologous chromosomes causing genetic recombination which leads to variation
24906,"sexual reproduction in plants: it occurs mostly in flowering plants.’ in fact, flowers are the reproductive organ of plants"
24907,pollen grains of a flower transfer to the stigma of the carpel of the same flower (self-pollination) or to the carpel of another flower (cross-pollination)
24908,"this transfer of pollens is achieved by agents like wind, water or animals"
24909,"after pollination, the pollen grains reach the egg cell in the form of a pollen tube"
24910,the zygote divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule
24911,the ovule develops a rough coat and is converted into a seed
24912,"ovary grows rapidly and ripens to form fruit, while the seed contains the future plant or embryo which develops into a seedling under suitable conditions"
24913,reproduction in human beings: humans use a sexual mode of reproduction
24914,"it needs sexual maturation which includes the creation of the germ cells, i.e., egg (ova) in the female and sperm in the male partner and this period of sexual maturation is called puberty"
24915,the formation of the male germ cell (sperms) takes place in the testes (male reproductive organ)
24916,"actually, a pair of testes are located inside scrotum situated outside the abdominal cavity"
24917,it is meant to keep a relatively low temperature needed for the production of sperms by testes
24918,"testes release a male sex hormone called testosterone whose function is to: regulate the production of sperms; brings about changes in appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty; and the sperms along with the secretion of the prostate gland and seminal vesicle, together constitute semen, which is released and made to enter into the female genital tract during copulation"
24919,"female reproduction system: the female germ cells or eggs are made in the ovaries, a pair of which is located in both sides of the abdomen"
24920,"when a girl is bom, the ovaries already contain thousands of immature eggs"
24921,"at the time of puberty, some of these eggs start maturing"
24922,one egg is produced every month by one of the ovaries
24923,the egg is carried from the ovary to the womb through a fallopian tube
24924,these two fallopian tubes unite into an elastic bag like structure known as the uterus
24925,fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube of the female genital tract
24926,"the fertilized egg also called zygote gets implanted in the lining of the uterus, and starts dividing"
24927,the uterus is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo
24928,"if the zygote is not formed, the inner wall of uterus breaks which causes bleeding through vagina"
24929,the embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta
24930,placenta provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo
24931,similarly the wastes from developing embryo are removed to mother’s blood through placenta
24932,"the child is bom as a result of rhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus after nine months (36 weeks) of development inside the mother’s womb, called gestation period"
24933,the sexual cycle in a woman continues upto the age of 45 to 50 years
24934,"reproductive health: reproductive health means total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, z.e., physical, emotional, social and behavioural"
24935,"contraception: it is the avoidance of pregnancy through different methods—natural methods, barrier method, oral contraceptives, surgical methods"
24936,"advantages of contraception: help in birth control, prevent sexually transmitted diseases, prevent unwanted pregnancies, keep population explosion in check"
24937,reproduction is the process by which a living organism is able to produce new individuals of its own kind
24938,"unlike other life processes such as nutrition, respiration, etc., it is not essential to, maintain the life of an individual organism"
24939,but it is important for the existence and continuity of the species
24940,reproduction involves the creation of dna copy and additional cellular apparatus by the cell involved in the process
24941,this inbuilt tendency for variations during reproduction is the basis for evolution
24942,living organisms’ reproduce mainly through : asexual reproduction sexual reproduction 5
24943,asexual reproduction (a) single ceiled organisms reproduce through following ways: (ii) budding (also by multicellular organisms) (iii) spore formation (also by multicellular organisms) (b) asexual reproduction by multicellular organisms: (i) fragmentation and regeneration 6
24944,"fission: in unicellular organisms when cell becomes fully mature, it splits into two or more parts"
24945,"in organisms such as amoeba, splitting can take place in any plane"
24946,"but in organisms like leishmania, having whip like structure at one end of the cell, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to these structures"
24947,regeneration : it is the ability to give rise to new organism
24948,when the individual is cut or broken up into many pieces
24949,it can be seen in hydra and planaria and is known as regeneration
24950,"from this mass of cells, different cells undergo changes to become various cell types and tissues"
24951,these changes take place in an organised sequence referred to as ” development
24952,"however, regeneration is not the same as reproduction, since most organisms would not normally depend on being cut up to be able to reproduce"
24953,budding: organisms such as hydra use regenerative cells for reproduction in the process of budding
24954,"in hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division at one specific site"
24955,"these buds develop into tiny individuals and when fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent individuals"
24956,"during spore formation, knob like structure called sporangium develops from the fungal hypha"
24957,the spores are covered by thick walls that protect them until they come in contact with moist surface or substratum and can begin to grow
24958,during this process filament of spirogyra simply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation
24959,"this process occurs under favourable conditions of moisture, temperature, light and nutrient availability"
24960,"vegetative propagation: it is the simplest method of reproduction in some higher plants in which new plant is produced from any vegetative part of the plant such as root, stem, leaf, etc"
24961,"advantages of vegetative propagation : vegetative propagation is useful for plants those have lost the capacity to produce seeds, e.g"
24962,"moreover, all plants produced are genetically similar to the parent plant"
24963,"natural vegetative propagation: in some plants like guava, sweet potato, dahlia, roots sprout and grow into new plants during favourable conditions"
24964,"in some other,stems grow horizontally and develop root below and leaves above the ground"
24965,"many other common examples of vegetatively propagating plants are onion, banana, garlic, ginger, turmeric, bryophyllum and water hyacinth"
24966,vegetative propagation in bryophyllum: bryophyllum reproduces by the vegetative propagation method
24967,"during this method, buds produced in the notches along the leaf margin of bryophyllum fall on the soil and develop into new plants"
24968,sexual reproduction : sexual reproduction involves two individuals for producing a new individual
24969,"sexual reproduction begins with fertilization, which is defined as the union of two different gametes"
24970,the motile germ-cell fptrueh or sperm) is called the male gamete and germ-cell containing stored food (egg or ovum) is called the female gamete
24971,"after fertilization, a zygote is formed , which develops into a new organism"
24972,sexual reproduction in plants : the flowering plants or angiosperms bear special reproductive parts located in the flower
24973,"the flower may be unisexual (papaya, watermelon) when it contains either stamen or carpel or bisexual (hibiscus, mustard) when it contains both stamens and carpels"
24974,it has male reproductive part cal led stamen and a female reproductive part called carpel
24975,"the swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style and the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma"
24976,the ovary contains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell
24977,"each stamen consists of stalk called filament, and a flattened fertile top called anther"
24978,the pollen grains produce male gametes which fuse with (egg cel i) female gamete present in the ovule
24979,this fusion of the germ-cells or fertilization gives zygote which grows into a new plant
24980,pollination: it is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of flower
24981,"if this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is referred to as self-pollination, whereas if the pollen is transferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-pollination"
24982,"this transfer is carried out by different agencies like wind, water, insects or animals"
24983,fertilization: a tube grows out of pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the female germ-cells present in ovule in the ovary
24984,out of two male gametes present in pollen tube one fuses with egg to form zygote
24985,"after fertilization, the zygote divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule"
24986,the ovule develops a tough coat and gradually turns into a seed
24987,"meanwhile the petals, sepals, stamens, style and stigma may shrivel and fall off"
24988,reproduction in human beings : the reproductive organs of human beings are called gonads
24989,the male gonad produces sperms and female gonad produces ova (eggs) at the age of puberty (after attainment of sexual maturity)
24990,male reproductive system consists of the following organs: testes: a pair of testes are situated in scrotum that lie outside the abdominal cavity and behind the penis
24991,testosterone brings about changes in appearance of boys at the time of puberty
24992,"vas deferens: from each testis, a duct arises which is known as vas deferens which unites with a tube coming from urinary bladder"

25250,therefore 1v = 1joule/1coulomb = 1j/1c 1v = 1jc-1 voltmeter: an apparatus to measure the potential difference or electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit
25251,galvanometer: it is a device to detect current in an electric circuit
25252,"ohm’s law: ohm’s law states that the potential difference between two points is directly proportional to the electric current, at a constant temperature"
25253,"v ∝ i v = ri i = \(\frac { v }{ r }\) r = \(\frac { v }{ i }\) where, r is constant for the given conductor at a given temperature and is called resistance"
25254,resistance: resistance is the property of conductor which resists the flow of electric current through it
25255,ohm is denoted by greek letter ‘q’ 1 ohm: 1 ohm (q) of resistance (r) is equal to the flow 1a of current through a conductor between two points having a potential difference equal to 1v
25256,"this means; 1ω = \(\frac { 1v }{ 1a }\) from the expression of ohm’s law, it is obvious that electric current through a resistor is inversely proportional to resistance"
25257,this means electric current will decrease with an increase in resistance and vice versa

25272,"this means, resistance increases with increase in length of the conductor"
25273,this is the cause that long electric wires create more resistance to the electric current
25274,"thus, resistance (r) ∝ length of conductor (l) or, r ∝ l …(i) (iii) area of cross section: resistance r is inversely proportional to the area of cross section (a) of the conductor"
25275,this means r will decrease with an increase in the area of conductor and vice versa
25276,"more area of conductor facilitates the flow of electric current through more area and thus, decreases the resistance"
25277,this is the cause that thick copper wire creates less resistance to the electric current
25278,"thus, resistance (r) ∝ 1/area of cross section of conductor (a) or, r ∝ \(\frac { l }{ a }\) ….(ii) from equations (i) and (ii) r ∝ \(\frac { l }{ a }\) r = ρ \(\frac { l }{ a }\) where, ρ (rho) is the proportionality constant"

25328,the heat generated by electric current: the potential difference between two points in an electrical field is equal to the work done in moving a unit charge from one point to another
25329,"then, work is done, w = vq and q = i × t w = v × i × t from ohm’s law, we know that v = ir w = ir × i × t = i2.rt since heat produced by the electric current is equal to work done, w h = w ⇒ h (heat) = i2rt joule"

25406,green plants capture about 1% of the solar energy incident on the earth through the biochemical process of photosynthesis
25407,a part of this trapped energy is used by plants in performing their metabolic activities and some energy is released as heat into the atmosphere
25408,the remaining energy is chemical energy stored in the plants as ‘carbohydrates’
25409,"when plants are eaten up by herbivores, the chemical energy stored in the plants is transferred to these animals"
25410,"these animals (herbivores) utilize some of this energy for metabolic activities, some energy is “released as heat and the remaining energy is stored"

25412,ten percent law: ten percent law states that only 10 percent of the energy entering a particular trophic level of organisms is available for transfer to the next higher trophic level
25413,"for example, suppose 1000 j of solar energy is received by green plants, then only 1% of solar energy available on earth is utilized by plants"
25414,so only 10 j (1% of 1000 j) is trapped by plants and the rest 990 j of energy is lost to the environment
25415,"next, only 10% of the 10 j energy of plant, that is, 1 j, is available to the herbivore animal while 9 j is lost to the environment"
25416,"again, just 10% of the 1 j of energy of herbivore animals is utilized by carnivore animals"
25417,"thus, carnivore animals have only 0.1 j of energy while 0.9 j is lost to the environment"

25466,"environment: the physical, chemical and ‘ biological conditions of the region in which an organism lives is called its environment"
25467,"it includes air, light, soil, temperature, water and the presence or absence of other organisms, i.e., the conditions for development or growth"
25468,"the environment has three main components, viz : physical surroundings [soil, air and water bodies] living organisms [plants, animals, decomposers (bacteria and fungi)] meteorological factors (or climatic factors)"
25469,physical environment: it is also called a abiotic or non-living environment
25470,"it includes : soil, water bodies and air on the surface of the earth"
25471,the physical environment is essential for : supply of nutrient elements to the living beings
25472,other important constituents of the biotic environment includes kites and vultures as they feed on dead organisms and act as scavengers (cleansing agents) of the environment
25473,"ecosystem: a community of organisms, interacting with each other, plus the environment in which they live and with which they also interact"
25474,the examples of the ecosystem are a pond; a desert; a forest; a lake; a river; a mountain; the sea
25475,all the above ecosystems are made up of two main components
25476,community in which one organism.e^ts other and is itself eaten by another organism to transfer energy is called a food chain
25477,"it is also defined as, “chain of organisms, existing in any natural community, through which energy is transferred”"
25478,"ozone layer : ozone (o3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen unlike oxygen which is required for respiration by aerobic forms, ozone is a deadly poison"
25479,"however, at the higher levels of the atmosphere, ozone performs an essential function"
25480,it shields the surface of the earth from ultraviolet (uv) radiation from the sun
25481,"this radiation is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin cancer in human beings"
25482,"ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of uv radiation, acting on oxygen (o2) molecule"
25483,the higher energy uv radiations split apart some molecular oxygen (o2) into free oxygen (o) atoms
25484,"these atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form ozone as shown: depletion of ozone layer: ozone layer gets depleted – due to the use of chemicals called aerosol, spray propellants like chlorofluorocarbons"
25485,depletion of ‘ ozone layer would cause skin cancer in men and animals and severe damage to the plants
25486,"biological magnification: it means accumulation of non-biodegradable chemicals (like pesticides) in the living organisms (like plants, animals, including man) in a food chain"
25487,“the increase in the concentration of harmful chemicals in the body of living organisms at each trophic level of a food chain is called biological magnification”
25488,food web: a food web is a network of food chains which establish a network of relationships between various species
25489,the flow of energy between various components of the environment: green plants capture about 1 % of the energy and convert it into food energy
25490,about f % of the food eaten is turned into the body of an organism and made available for the next level of consumers
25491,about 10% of organic matter is present at each step and reaches the next level of consumers
25492,"since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers, food chains generally consist of only three or four steps"
25493,the loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy remains after four trophic levels
25494,"there are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the producers"
25495,"if you have any query regarding ncert class 10 science notes chapter 15 our environment, drop a comment below and we will get back to you at the earliest"
25496,(a) inexhaustible: these are in plenty and cannot be exhausted by man’s consumption
25497,"(b) exhaustible: these are limited and can get exhausted over a period of time, i.e., coal, petroleum etc"
25498,"management of natural resources: a system of controlling the use of natural resources in such a way, as to avoid their wastage and to use them in the most effective way is called management of natural resources"
25499,why do we need to manage our natural resources: we need to manage our natural resources because of the following reasons : the resources of the earth are limited
25500,"because of the rapid increase in human population, the demand for resources is increasing day-by-day"
25501,"the proper management can ensure that the natural resources are used judiciously, so that they fulfill the needs of present generation and also last for the generations to come"
25502,– the proper management of natural resources takes into consideration long-term perspective (or view) and prevents their exploitation to hilt for short-term gains
25503,the proper management can ensure equitable distribution of natural resources so that all the people can benefit from the development of these resources
25504,the proper management will take into consideration the damage caused to the environment during the ‘extraction’ or ‘use’ of the natural resources and find ways and means to minimise this damage
25505,conservation of wildlife: it is very important to conserve wild-life to maintain the ecological balance in nature and to preserve the gene pool
25506,some of the measures (or steps) to be taken for the conservation of wildlife are given below: laws should be made to impose a total ban on the poaching (killing) or capturing of any animal or bird belonging to an endangered species
25507,the natural habitats of wild animals and birds should be preserved by establishing national parks and sanctuaries throughout the country
25508,"the government department connected with the conservation of wildlife should conduct a periodic survey in all the forests, national parks and sanctuaries to have knowledge of the population of all species of wild animals and birds"
25509,special attention should be paid to the conservation of endangered species of wild animals and birds to prevent their extinction altogether
25510,the unauthorized felling (cutting) of forest trees for timber trade and fuel-wood should be curbed (stopped) immediately
25511,"biodiversity of an area is the number of species of different life forms like bacteria, fungi, powering plants insects, birds, etc"
25512,loss of diversity may lead to a loss of ecological stability/ecological imbalance
25513,stake holders: a person having interest or concern for something is called as a stakeholder
25514,sustainable management: management of forest resources wisely to make it available for future generations
25515,"to consider the conservation of forests, we need to look at the stakeholders who are : the people who live in or around forests are dependent on forest products for various aspects of their life"
25516,the forest department of the government which owns the land and controls the resources from forests
25517,the industrialists—from those who use ‘tendu’ leaves to make bidis to the ones with papermills who use various forest produce
25518,the wild life and nature enthusiasts who want to conserve nature in its pristine form
25519,a major program called silviculture has been started to replenish the forests by growing more trees and plants
25520,conservation of forests: it is carried out by the following methods afforestation: it is growing of forests on unprotected barren lands
25521,van mahotsava is a tree plantation movement carried out twice a year (february and july) by both government and voluntary agencies
25522,reforestation: it is developing forest cover in the area which has been damaged or cleared during exploitation
25523,separation of commercial forestry: useful plants required by industry should be planted separately preferably on waste land
25524,grazing: grazing should be regulated according to the availability of pasturage
25525,"deforestation: removal, decreases or deterioration of forest cover of an area is called deforestation"
25526,effects of deforestation soil erosion: removal of plant cover exposes the fertile soil to wind and water
25527,the latter remove the top soil and make the area infertile
25528,desertification: removal of forest cover in the plains makes the area dry
25529,air currents take away the fine soil particles leaving behind sand
25530,floods: in rainy season many temporary rivulets are formed due to loss of absorption capacity by unprotected soil
25531,"the rivulets produce floods in low land causing loss to agriculture, property and life"
25532,destruction of wildlife: deforestation leads to destruction of natural habitats of wild animals and plants
25533,"climatic changes: in the absence of forest cover, the summer becomes hotter while the winters become extra cool"
25534,"national award for wildlife conservation: the govt, of india, has recently instituted an ‘amrita devi bishnoi national award for wildlife conservation in the memory of amrita devi, who in 1931 sacrificed her life along with 363 other for the protection ‘khejri trees’ in kherali village near jodhpur in rajasthan"
25535,chipko andolan: movement originated in garhwal in early 1970’s that was the result of a grassroot level effort to end the alienation of people from their forest
25536,"thus, chipko movement (i.e., chipko andolan) is the tree hugging movement, in which the villagers compel the axeman to stop tree felling by embracing and forming ring (circle) around the marked trees"
25537,example : protection of sal forest in west bengal in 1972
25538,water as a resource water is a basic necessity for all terrestrial forms of life
25539,regions of water scarcity are closely related to the regions of acute poverty
25540,"failure to sustain water availability has resulted in loss of vegetation cover, diversion for high water demanding crops and pollution from industries and, urban wastes and less rain"
25541,"irrigation methods like dams, tanks should be used in various part of india"
25542,advantages of dams water from a dam is used for irrigation in fields through a network of canals
25543,dams ensure round the year water supply to the crop fields and help raise agricultural production
25544,water from a dam is supplied to the people in towns and cities through pipelines after suitable treatment
25545,"in this way, construction of dams ensures continuous water supply in the region"
25546,the falling water (or flowing water) from the dam is used for generating electricity
25547,the water rushing down the dam turns turbines which run electric generators
25548,"disadvantages of dams social problems: due to the construction of high-rise dams, a large number of human settlements (or villages) are submerged in the water of large reservoir formed by the dam and many people are rendered homeless"
25549,environmental problems: the construction of high-rise dams on the rivers contributes to deforestation and loss of biodiversity
25550,this is because a vast variety of flora and fauna (plants and animals) get submerged in the water of large reservoir formed by the dam and disturb the ecological balance
25551,economic problems: some people say that the construction of high-rise dams involves the spending of a huge amount of public money without the generation of proportionate benefits
25552,"forests: forests are important renewable natural resources dominated mainly by trees forming a sort of canopy, they are essential for the ecological balance of all ecosystems"
25553,water harvesting: aim is to develop primary resources of land and water and to produce secondary resources of plants and animals for use in a manner which will not cause ecological imbalance
25554,these techniques are local specific to ensure the mismanagement and over-exploitation of these resources
25555,ground water is protected from contamination by human and animal waste
25556,pollution of water: the pollution of water is caused by the dumping of untreated sewage and industrial wastes into it
25557,"the contamination of river water can be usually found from two factors : the presence of coliform bacteria in river water, and measurement of ph of river water"
25558,gangs action plan (gap): muticrore project came in 1985 to improve the quality of ganga
25559,ganga action plan (gap) was formulated to reduce the pollution load of river ganga by more than 75%
25560,the water quality has been tested from time-to-time by checking coliform (a group of harmless bacteria in human intestine) number/100 ml
25561,"accordingly, a survey was conducted and data was collected for total coliform (a group of bacteria found in human intestine) between 1993-1994 which was as below: mpn – most probable number"
25562,advantages of water stored in the ground the water stored in the ground does not evaporate
25563,the water stored in the ground spreads out to recharge wells and provides moisture for crops over a wide area
25564,the water stored in the ground does not promote the breeding of mosquitoes (unlike stagnant water collected in ponds or artificial lakes)
25565,the water stored in the ground is protected from contamination by human and animal waste
25566,coal and petroleum conservation: coal and petroleum are fossil fuels found in earth’s crust
25567,coal: coal is combustible fossilized rock derived from a large accumulation of plant remains that is gradually compressed
25568,"coal is used for cooking, heating, in industry and thermal power plants"
25569,petroleum: petroleum is another fossil fuel that occurs in the form of liquid oil
25570,it has been formed in the past (about 10 to 20 crore years old) from plant and animal remains and occur in the form of mineral oil in sedimentaiy rocks
25571,"petroleum is mainly used as fuel for transport, agricultural operations, generators and some industries"
25572,methods of conservation of fossil fuels burning of coal causes air pollution
25573,thus direct use of coal for the purpose or burning should be avoided
25574,coal may be converted into liquid fuel and compressed natural gas (cng) through coal gasification
25575,techniques should be developed to recover maximum fossil fuel that lies in deep mines and wells
25576,both oil wells and coal mines are prone to catch fire
25577,"therefore, these should be well protected from fire to avoid wastage pollution and loss of life and property"
25578,we must save oil for future use because only a few years are left for its depletion
25579,"alternative sources of energy, such as hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, wind power and biogas plants should be encouraged"
25580,fuel efficient motor vehicle should be designed to reduce consumption of petrol and diesel
25581,management of natural resources is needed for the conservation of natural resources
25582,there are national and international laws and acts to protect the environment
25583,multi crore project came in 1985 to improve the quality of ganga — accordingly a survey was conducted and a data was collected of total coliform (a group of bacteria found in human intestine) between 1993-1994 national award for wildlife conservation – in the memory amrita devi bishnoi who lost her life in the protection of khejri trees in rajasthan along with 363 other people
25584,chipko movement: chipko movement is an example of the contribution of common people towards the conservation of forests
25585,"the chipko movement also called ‘hug the tree’ movement originated from an incident in a remote village called ‘reni’ in garhwal (himalayas), where the people of this village clasped the tree trunks with their arms to protect them from being cut down by a contractor’s workers"
25586,the people acted this way because they knew that this mass deforestation would spoil their healthy environment
25587,the chipko movement quickly spread across all the communities and helped in the conservation of forests and thus helped in safeguarding the environment
25588,"reduce: it means we should minimise our use of natural resources, sources of energy and food materials"
25589,"recycle: it means that we should collect materials like paper, plastics, glass and metal items"
25590,these waste materials should be recycled to obtain these materials again for use
25591,"reuse: in this strategy, we should be encouraged to use things again and again instead of throwing them away"
25592,"for example, plastic bottles those we get with jams and pickle can be reused for storing things in the kitchen"
25593,"biodiversity of an area is the number of species of different life forms like bacteria, fungi, powering plants insects, birds etc"
25594,the main aim of forest conservation is to preserve the biodiversity we have inherited
25595,"stakeholders: those persons, who are directly or indirectly involved in using the produce of forests or are interested in the conservation of forests, are called stakeholders"
25596,loss of diversity may lead to a loss of ecological stability/ecological imbalance
25597,sustainable management: management of forest resources wisely to make it available for future generations
25598,"sustainable development is development encourages the judicious use of natural resources to meet the current basic human needs, while preserving the resources for the needs of future generations"
25599,water as a resource: water is a basic necessity for all terrestrial forms of life
25600,regions of water scarcity are closely correlated to the regions of acute poverty
25601,"failure to sustain water availability has resulted in the loss of vegetation cover, diversion for high water demanding crops and pollution from industries and urban wastes and less rain"
25602,"irrigation methods like dams, tanks and coals have been used in various part of india"
25603,"dams: in order to make proper use of river water, dams are constructed across the rivers to regulate the flow of water"
25604,a dam has a large reservoir to store huge amounts of water
25605,this stored water is then allowed to flow downstream at the desired rate
25606,water from a dam is used for irrigation in fields through a network of canals
25607,dams ensure round the year water supply to the crop fields and help raise agricultural production
25608,the water rushing down the dam turns turbines which run electric generators to generate electricity
25609,construction of large dams addresses three problems in particular- social problem
25610,a large number of local people have to be displaced which includes farmers and tribals without their adequate compensation or rehabilitation
25611,as dams are built up with huge amounts of public money without the generation of proportionate benefits
25612,because the making of large dams contributes enormously to deforestation and the loss of biological diversity
25613,water harvesting: collecting rainwater for use in future by storing it in storage reservoirs is called rainwater harvesting
25614,these techniques are locale specific to ensure the mismanagement and over-exploitation of these resources
25615,advantages of khadin system water does not evaporate recharge wells and moisture for vegetation
25616,does not provide a breeding ground for mosquito groundwater is protected from human and animal waste
25617,"green house effect: when the reflected back infra-red rays (of longer wave-length) of the sun are entrapped by c02 gas of atmosphere, the atmosphere gets warmed"
25618,"1. a coliform is a group of bacteria, found in human intestines, whose presence in water indicates contamination by disease-causing microorganisms"
25619,"in 1985, our government started a multi-crore project named as ‘ganga action plan’"
25620,the main aim of this project is to improve the water quality of our holy river ganga
25621,the water of the river ganga gets polluted because of the following reasons : dumping of untreated sewage
25622,"this all pollutes water, increasing the toxicity level which kills fish in large sections of the river"
25623,one should keep in mind the three r’s to save the environment: reduce: using less and less of natural resources
25624,"one can help by switching off unnecessary lights and fans, repairing leaky taps, preventing wastage of food"
25625,reuse: it is better than recycling because the process of recycling uses some energy
25626,"the concept of sustainable development encourages forms of growth that meet current basic human needs, while preserving the resources for the needs of future generation"
25627,the sustainable development : it implies a change in all aspects of life
25628,it depends upon the willingness of the people to change their perceptions of the socioeconomic and environmental conditions around them and the readiness of each individual to alter their present use of natural resources
25629,sustainable natural resource management demands the following: using resources carefully because these are not unlimited
25630,a long term perspective so that these resources will last for the generations to come and will not merely be exploited for short-term gains
25631,"equitable distribution of resources so that all and not just a handful of rich and powerful people, benefit from the development of these resources"
25632,"checking the damage caused to the environment while these resources are either extracted or used, planning for the safe disposal of the waste which is generated when natural resources are either extracted or used"
25633,one measure of the biodiversity of.an area is the number of different species found there
25634,"however, the range of different life forms (such as bacteria, fungi, ferns, flowering plants, nematodes, insects, birds, reptiles and so on) is also important"
25635,one of the main aim of conservation is to try and preserve the biodiversity that we have inherited
25636,a loss of diversity may lead to a loss of ecological stability
25637,forest resources ought to be used in a manner that is both environmentally and developmentally sound
25638,"the destruction of forests not only affects the availability of forest products, but also the quality of soil and the sources of water"
25639,"despite nature’s monsoon bounty, failure to sustain water availability underground has resulted largely from the loss of vegetation cover, diversion for high water demanding crops and pollution from industrial effluents and urban wastes"
25640,dams are built to ensure the storage of adequate water not only for irrigation but also for generating electricity
25641,"however, building of large dams cause social, economic and environmental problem"
25642,watershed management: watershed management emphasises scientific soil and water conservation in order to increase the biomass production
25643,"the aim is to develop primary resources of land and water, to produce secondary resources of plants and animals for use in a manner which will not cause ecological imbalance"
25644,"watershed management not only increase the production and income of the watershed : community, but also mitigates droughts and floods and increases the life of the downstream dam and reservoirs"
25645,the chipko andolan (‘hug the trees movement’) : it started in a remote village called reni in garhwal in early 1970s
25646,"in this movement, women of the village used to clasp the tree trunks thus preventing the felling of trees"
25647,"role of chipko andolan : it helped in conservation and preservation of forests, one of the most important natural resources"
25648,it allowed the village communities to utilise the forest produce and allowing the resource to replenish over time
25649,"it taught people that, the destruction of forests not only affects the availability of forest products but also the quality of soil and the sources of water"
25650,it forced government to rethink the priorities of the local people (to whom the forests belong) in the use of forest produce
25651,it encouraged the participation of the local people in the efficient management of forests
25652,stakeholders of forest: people living in or around forest: they depend on forest produce for their living
25653,the forest department of the government : which owns the land and controls the resources from forests
25654,"the industrialists : who use various forest produce as raw material, but are not dependent on the forest in any orie area"
25655,the wildlife and nature enthusiasts: who want to conserve nature in its pristine form
25656,water harvesting : it is an age-old concept in india which involves capturing rainwater in the large structures which can hold this water round the year
25657,the main purpose is not only to hold the surface water but also to recharge the groundwater beneath
25658,"advantages of water harvesting : the water does not evaporate, but spreads out to recharge wells and provides moisture for vegetation over a wide area"
25659,it does not provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes like stagnant water collected in ponds or artificial lakes

25662,properties of magnet a free suspended magnet always points towards the north and south direction
25663,the pole of a magnet which points toward north direction is called north pole or north-seeking
25664,the pole of a magnet which points toward south direction is called south pole or south seeking
25665,like poles of magnets repel each other while unlike poles of magnets attract each other
25666,magnetic field: the area around a magnet where a magnetic force is experienced is called the magnetic field
25667,"it is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude, (i.e., vector quantity)"
25668,magnetic field and field lines: the influence of force surrounding a magnet is called magnetic field
25669,"in the magnetic field, the force exerted by a magnet can be detected using a compass or any other magnet"
25670,the imaginary lines of magnetic field around a magnet are called field line or field line of magnet
25671,"when iron fillings are allowed to settle around a bar magnet, they get arranged in a pattern which mimicks the magnetic field lines"
25672,field line of a magnet can also be detected using a compass
25673,"direction of field line: outside the magnet, the direction of magnetic field line is taken from north pole to south pole"
25674,"inside the magnet, the direction of magnetic field line is taken from south pole to north pole"
25675,"strength of magnetic field: the closeness of field lines shows the relative strength of magnetic field, i.e"
25676,crowded field lines near the poles of magnet show more strength
25677,properties of magnetic field lines (i) they do not intersect each other
25678,(ii) it is taken by convention that magnetic field lines emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole
25679,"inside the magnet, their direction is from south pole to north pole"
25680,"magnetic field lines due to current a current carrying straight conductor a current carrying straight conductor has magnetic field in the form of concentric circles, around it"
25681,magnetic field of current carrying straight conductor can be shown by magnetic field lines
25682,the direction of magnetic field through a current carrying conductor depends upon the direction of flow electric current
25683,let a current carrying conductor be suspended vertically and the electric current is flowing from south to north
25684,"in this case, the direction of magnetic field will be anticlockwise"
25685,"if the current is flowing from north to south, the direction of magnetic field will be clockwise"
25686,"the direction of magnetic field, in relation to direction of electric current through a straight conductor can be depicted by using the right hand thumb rule"
25687,"right-hand thumb rule: if a current carrying conductor is held by right hand, keeping the thumb straight and if the direction of electric current is in the direction of thumb, then the direction of wrapping of other fingers will show the direction of magnetic field"
25688,"maxwell’s corkscrew rule: as per maxwell’s corkscrew rule, if the direction of forward movement of screw shows the direction of the current, then the direction of rotation of screw shows the direction of magnetic field"
25689,properties of magnetic field the magnitude of magnetic field increases with increase in electric current and decreases with decrease in electric current
25690,the magnitude of magnetic field produced by electric current decreases with increase in distance and vice – versa
25691,"the size of concentric circles of magnetic field lines increases with distance from the conductor, which shows that magnetic field decreases with distance"
25692,"magnetic field lines due to a current through a circular loop in case of a circular current carrying conductor, the magnetic field is produced in the same manner as it is in case of a straight current carrying conductor"
25693,"in case of a circular current carrying conductor, the magnetic field lines would be in the form of iron concentric circles around every part of the fllmss periphery of the conductor"
25694,"since, magnetic field lines tend to remain closer when near to the conductor, so the magnetic field would be stronger near the periphery of the loop"
25695,"on the other hand, the magnetic field lines would be distant from each other when we move towards the centre of the current carrying loop"
25696,"finally, at the centre, the arcs of big circles would appear as a straight line"
25697,the direction of the magnetic field can be identified using right hand thumb’s rule
25698,let us assume that the current is moving in anti-clockwise direction in the loop
25699,"in that case, the magnetic field would be in clockwise direction, at the top of the loop"
25700,"moreover, it would be in an anti-clockwise direction at the bottom of the loop"
25701,clock face rule: a current carrying loop works like a disc magnet
25702,the polarity of this magnet can be easily understood with the help of clock face rule
25703,"if the current is flowing in anti – clockwise direction, then the face of the loop shows north pole"
25704,"on the other hand, if the current is flowing in clockwise direction, then the face of the loop shows south pole"
25705,magnetic field and number of turns of coil: magnitude of magnetic field gets summed up with increase in the number of turns of coil
25706,"if there are ‘n’ turns of coil, magnitude of magnetic field will be ‘n’ times of magnetic field in case of a single turn of coil"
25707,the strength of the magnetic field at the centre of the loop(coil) depends on : (i) the radius of the coil: the strength of the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the radius of the coil
25708,"if the radius increases, the magnetic strength at the centre decreases (ii) the number of turns in the coil : as the number of turns in the coil increase, the magnetic strength at the centre increases, because the current in each circular turn is having the same direction, thus, the field due to each turn adds up"
25709,"(iii) the strength of the current flowing in the coil: as the strength of the current increases, the strength of three magnetic fields also increases"
25710,magnetic field due to a current in a solenoid: solenoid is the coil with many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder
25711,a current carrying solenoid produces similar pattern of magnetic field as a bar magnet
25712,one end of solenoid behaves as the north pole and another end behaves as the south pole
25713,"magnetic field lines are parallel inside the solenoid, similar to a bar magnet, which shows that magnetic field is same at all points inside the solenoid"
25714,magnetic field produced by a solenoid is similar to a bar magnet
25715,the strength of magnetic field is proportional to the number of turns and magnitude of current
25716,"by producing a strong magnetic field inside the solenoid, magnetic materials can be magnetized"
25717,magnet formed by producing magnetic field inside a solenoid is called electromagnet
